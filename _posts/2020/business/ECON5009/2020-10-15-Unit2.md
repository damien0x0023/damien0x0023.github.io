- then the unit demonstrates how to use arbitrage arguments to determine forward and futures prices of an investment asset from its spot price and other ovservable market variables
- next, the valuation of forward contracts is studied in rich detail
- the principles of hedging is understood using a numerical example
- then, the specifications of an option contract, the profits and payoffs of different option positioins are studied

### I.i Forward Contracts

1. **Definition**: A forward contract is an **agreement**, i.e. a binding commitment, to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price.

2. A forward contract is traded in the **over-the-counter market**. 
The party who takes **the long position** agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price. 
The other party who takes **the short position** agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price.

### I.ii Futures Contracts

1. **Definition**: A futures contract is an **agreement** between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price with (daily) clearing through a margin account.

2. Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts are normally **traded on an exchange**. 
This suggests that, the exchange specifies certain standardized features of the contract, i.e. the underlying asset, the contract size and delivery details; 
the exchange also provides a mechanism that gives the two parties of the futures contract a guarantee that the contract will be honored.

3. Underlying assets: commodities, e.g. lumber, crude oil, gold; financial assets, e.g. stock indices, currencies, Treasury bonds.

4. **Delivery Month**: A futures contract is referred to by its delivery month. 
For instance, the product code of CME Gold futures contract for December 2019 is 'GCZ19'.

5. The trader who agrees to buy has a **long futures position** in the contract; the trader who agrees to sell has a **short futures position** in the contract. 
The price agrred to is the current futures price, which is determined by the law of supply and demand.

6. Market Quetos: last trade, change, priort settlement, open, high, low, trading volume.

### I.iii The Operation of Margin Accounts

1. Both forward and futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an assset for a certain price at a certain future time.

2. The main differences between forward and futures contracts are summarised in the following table.

        &emsp;\text{Comparison of Forward and Futures Contract.} \\\\
        \hline
        \text {Forward} & \text {Futures}\\\\
        \hline
        \text {traded in the OTC market} & \text {traded on the exchange} \\\\
        \text {not standardized} & \text {standardized contract}\\\\
        \text {usually one specified delivery date} & \text {range of delivery dates}\\\\
        \text {settled at the expiry} & \text {settled daily}\\\\
        \text {usually leading to delivery or cash settlement} & \text {usually closed out prior to maturity}\\\\
        \text {some credit check} & \text {virtually no credit check}\\\\
        \hline
    \end{array}

### I.iv Arbitrage: Non-dividend-paying Stock

1. **Arbitrage**: an arbitrage is defined as a trading strategy that require zero initial investment, has zero probability of losing money, and has a positive probability of making money.
**A mathematical model that admits arbitrage leads to contradictions.** 
Wealth could be generated from nothing in such a model, in consequence prices would adjust through supply and demand to eliminate the arbitrage.
CAPM uses a slightly different notion of arbitrage!  

2. We use arbitrage arguments to determine the forward and futures prices of an investment asset from its spot price and other observable market variables.
