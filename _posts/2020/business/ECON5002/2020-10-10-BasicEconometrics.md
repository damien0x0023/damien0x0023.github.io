#  Basic Econometrics - Unit 1 Introduction 

**Experimental and Observational Data, Causality and the Ceteris Paribus condition.**

## **Experimental Data**

- Suppose we are interested in evaluating the effects of a new fertilizer on crop yields. 

- To determine the causal effect of the fertilizer amount on crop yields we can conduct an experiment.

- Experiment design: choose several one-acre plots of land; **randomly** assign different amounts of fertilizer to the different plots; compare yields.

- Ideally, all the other factors that influence crop yields such as quality of land, rainfall, presence of parasites etc. should be constant across the plots (**ceteris paribus**: other things
equal).

- Other things are unlikely to be equal across units!

- However, if we randomly assign the fertilizer and we have many plots, the individual features of each plot will be washed out. We can still infer causality!

Key point: The fertilizer assigned to the plots is independent of other factors affecting yields.

- The Perry project is an experiment designed to assess the effect of high-quality education on children.

- 123 preschool children assessed to be at high risk of failure in school were randomly divided into two groups.

- One group entered a high-quality preschool programme, the other group received no preschool education.

- The project was conducted in 1962-1967 in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Students were followed trough their lives.

- At the age of 40, the participants in the pre-school programme were found to be more likely to have graduated from high school, committed fewer crimes,...

## **Observational Data**

- The previous experiment can be costly and could be criticized as unethical.

- To investigate similar topics, e.g. return to education, most economic data is observational.

- If a person is chosen from the population and given another year of education, by how much will his/her wage increase?

- We can use a survey to collect data on education and wages of a sample of individuals. The data will be treated as realizations of a (bivariate) random variables.

Key point: people choose their education.

- More educated pe ple tend to earn more than less educated people.

- Smart people usually earn higher wages.  
Smart people often choose higher levels of education.

- Being smart could be the fundamental reason for the higher wage of more educated people (positive correlation between education and wages could be misleading).

- The level of education is not determined randomly (as the fertilizer), but influenced by other factors (e.g. intelligence) that affect wages, and are different across units.

## **Takeaway**

- Even if we deal with observational data, it is useful to think about an experiment one would have run if possible.

- The previous example (return to education) highlighted the difficulties that arise when inferring causality in applied
economics.

- Using multiple regression we can still infer causal effects from observational data.
