### 1.1 Forwards
**Forward Contracts**

1. **Definition**: A forward contract is an **agreement**, i.e. a binding commitment, to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price.

A forward contract is traded in the **over-the-counter market**. 
The party who takes **the long position** agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price. 
The other party who takes **the short position** agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price.

### 1.2 Futures
**Futures Contracts**

1. **Definition**: A futures contract is an **agreement** between two parties to buy or seAll an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price with (daily) clearing through a margin account.

Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts are normally **traded on an exchange**. 
This suggests that, the exchange specifies certain standardized features of the contract, i.e. the underlying asset, the contract size and delivery details; 
the exchange also provides a mechanism that gives the two parties of the futures contract a guarantee that the contract will be honored.

- Underlying assets: commodities, e.g. lumber, crude oil, gold; financial assets, e.g. stock indices, currencies, Treasury bonds.

- **Delivery Month**: A futures contract is referred to by its delivery month. 
For instance, the product code of CME Gold futures contract for December 2019 is 'GCZ19'.

The trader who agrees to buy has a **long futures position** in the contract; the trader who agrees to sell has a **short futures position** in the contract. 
The price agrred to is the current futures price, which is determined by the law of supply and demand.

- Market Quetos: last trade, change, priort settlement, open, high, low, trading volume.

### 1.3 The Operation of Margin Accounts

1. One of  the  key roles of  the  exchange is to	use **margin accounts** to	organize trading so that contract defaults are avoided.

2. The	amount that  must  be deposited  at  the  time the contract  is entered  into  is known as the	**initial margin**.

3. At  the  end of  each trading day, the margin  account  is adjusted to	reflect the investor's  gain or loss.
This  practice  is referred to	as **daily settlement** or **marking to  market**.
More specifically, a trade is first settled at  the  close of the	day  on which  it takes place.
It	is then settled at the close of trading on each subsequent	day.
By contrast, the forward contracts are settled at the expiry.

4. To ensure that the balance in the margin account never becomes negative a **maintenance margin** is set.
If  the  balance in the	margin account falls below the  maintenance  margin, the  investor  receives  a  margin call and is expected to top	up the  margin  account  to  the  initial  margin  level by the	end of the next day.

5. The	extra  funds deposited  are known  as a  variation margin.	
If the investor does not	provide the variation margin, the broker **closes out the position by entering into the opposite trade to the original one**.

**An example**

Both forward and futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an assset for a certain price at a certain future time.
The main differences between forward and futures contracts are summarised in the following table.

### 1.4 Arbitrage

**Arbitrage: Non-dividend-paying Stock**

- **Arbitrage**: an arbitrage is defined as a trading strategy that require zero initial investment, has zero probability of losing money, and has a positive probability of making money.

**A mathematical model that admits arbitrage leads to contradictions.** 
Wealth could be generated from nothing in such a model, in consequence prices would adjust through supply and demand to eliminate the arbitrage. 
CAPM uses a slightly different notion of arbitrage!  

We use **arbitrage arguments** to determine the forward and futures prices of an investment asset from its spot price and other observable market variables.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5009/arbitrageOpportunities.png "Arbitrage Opportunities (without dividends) (Hull(2015) p.108)")

### 1.5 Forward Price (no income)
**Forward Price for an Investment: No Income**

From Example 5, the first arbitrage works as long as the forward price is greater than 40.5; the second arbitrage works as long as the forward price is less than 40.5.

Based on the previous analysis, now consider a forward contract on an investment asset with price \\( S_0\\) that provides no income ( and no costs), e.g. non-dividend-paying stocks.
The relationship between \\( F_0\\) and \\( S_0\\) is 

$$
    F_0 = S_0 e^{rT} 
    \tag{2} \label{forwardPrice}
$$

If \\( F_0 > S_0 e^{rT} \\), arbitrageurs can buy the asset and short forward contracts on the asset; if \\( F_0 < S_0 e^{rT} \\), arbitrageurs can short the asset and enter into long forward contract on it.

**Intuition**: consider the following strategy:	buy one unit of the asset and enter into a short forward contract to sell it for \\( F_0\\) at time \\(T\\). Buying the asset costs \\( S_0\\), the strategy is certain to lead to	a cash inflow of \\( F_0\\) at time \\(T\\). 
Therefore, \\( S_0\\) must equal the present value of \\( F_0\\), i.e. \\( S_0 = F_0 e^{-rT}\\). Thus, \\( F_0 = S_0 e^{rT}\\). 

Indeed, using equation \eqref{forwardPrice}, the forward price from Example 5 is
$$
    F_0 = 40e^{0.05 \times 0.25} = 40.5.
$$

**Arbitrage: Coupon-bearing Bond**
 
Guideline for arbitrage: the guiding principle of taking arbitrage opportunity is to buy low and sell high.	
In other words, when the forward price is higher than its no-arbitrage theoretical value, arbitrageurs buy the underlying asset; 
when the forward price is lower than its no-arbitrage theoretical value, arbitrageurs sell the underlying asset.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5009/arbitrageOpportunities_knownIncome.png "Arbitrage Opportunities (Known Income) (Hull(2015) p.110)")

**Forward Price	for	an Investment Asset: Known Income**

When an investment asset will provide known income with a present value of \\( G \\) during the life of a forward contract, we have:

$$
    F_0 = (S_0 - G) e^{rT}
    \tag{3} \label{forwardPriceWithIncome}
$$

Indeed, in Example 6, the forward price is:

$$
    F_0 = (900-39.6)e^{0.004 \times 0.75} = 886.6.
$$

If \\( F_0 > (S_0 - G) e^{rT}\\), an arbitrageur can lock in a profit by buying the asset and shorting a forward contract on the asset; if\\( F_0 < (S_0 - G) e^{rT}\\), an arbitrageur can lock in a profit by shorting the asset and taking a long position in a forward contract.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5009/ForwardPrice.png "Forward price (stock paying known dividends) (Hull(2015) p.111)")

We now consider the case where the asset underlying a forward contract provides a known yield, i.e.	a return provided by an instrument.	This means that the income is known when expressed as a percentage of the asset's price at the time the income is paid.

The yield is normally measured with continuous compounding.	A yield measured with one compounding frequency can be translated to a yield measured with another compounding frequency:

\\[
    R_c = m \cdot ln(1+ \frac{R_m}{m})
    \tag{4} \label{yield}
\\]

&emsp;where \\(R_c\\) denotes the annualized continuous-compounding yield; \\(m\\) is the compounding  frequency; \\(R_m\\) represents the annualized discrete-compounding yield.

After translating discrete-compounding yield into continuous-compounding yield,  we are ready to derive the forward price.	Define \\( q \\) as the average yield per annum on an asset during the life of a forward contract with continuous compounding. The forward price of an investment asset with known yield is:

\\[
    F_0 = S_0 e^{(r-q)T}
    \tag{5} \label{forwardPriceWithYield}
\\]

    Consider a 6-month forward contract on an asset that is expected to	provide income equal to	2% of the asset price once during a 6-month  period;  r = 10%; So =25. Therefore, the annualized yield is 4% with semiannual compounding. Using equation (4), the corresponding continuous-compounding yield can be computed as 3.96%.	Thus, from equation (5), the forward price is

\\[
    25e^{(0.1-0.0396) \times 0.5} = 25.77
\\]

**Valuing Forward Contracts**

**Timing of the life of forward contract:** 

Time 0 is the beginning of the life of the forward contract; time \\(t\\) is the current time, i.e. today; time \\(T\\) is	the delivery date (or maturity) of the forward contract.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5009/timeline.png "The Timeline of Forward Contract")

Suppose \\(K\\) is the delivery price for the contract that was negotiated at time 0 and \\(K = F'_0 \\), i.e. is set equal to the forward price at  time 0. As time passes, \\(K\\) stays constant (because it is agreed at time 0). \\( F_t\\) is the forward price that would be applicable if we negotiated the contract today. \\(T- t\\) is the time to maturity. In addition, we define \\(f_t\\) as the value of forward contract today.

Because it	costs nothing to enter into a forward  contract,  the  value  of a forward contract at the time  it  is first  entered  into is zero. As time evolves, due to the fluctuations of the interest rate and the spot  price  of  underlying asset, the forward price \\(f_t\\) changes and the value of the contract can become either positive or negative.

A general result, applicable to the value of any long forward contract, is:

\\[
     f_t = (F_t - K)e ^{-r(T-t)}
     \tag{6} \label{forwardValue}
\\]

**Intuition:**

1. We form a portfolio today consisting of (a) a forward contract to  buy  the underlying  asset  for \\( K\\) at  time \\( T\\) T, and	(b) a forward  contract  to sell the	asset for \\(F_t\\) at time \\(T\\).

2. The  payoff from the	portfolio at time \\(T\\) is \\(S_T - K\\) from contract (a) and \\(F_t - S_T\\) from contract (b).

3. The total payoff is \\( F_t - K\\) and is known for certain today. The portfolio  is therefore a risk-free investment and its value today is the payoff at time \\(T\\) discounted at the risk-free rate, i.e. \\( (F_t - K)e^{-r(T-t)}\\).

4. The  value of the forward  contract   (b)  is  worth  zero  because \\(F_t\\) is the forward price  that  applies  to   a  forward  contract  entered	into today.

5. Therefore,  the  value of a  long forward  contract to  buy an  asset for  \\( K\\)  at time \\(T\\)  must  be \\( (F_t - K)e^{-r(T-t)}\\).

6. Similarly, the	value  of  a  short  forward  contract  to sell the	asset for  \\( K\\)  at	time \\(T\\) is \\( (K- F_t)e^{-r(T-t)}\\).

**Are Forward Prices and Futures Prices Equal?**


\\( \underline{\text{Technical Note 24}} \\) from **Hull** (2015) uses the	arbitrage  argument  to  show that, when the risk-free rate is constant, the  forward  price  for  a  contract  with a certain  delivery date is **in theory** the same as the	futures price for  a contract with  that delivery  date.	This argument can be extended to the case where the interest  rate is a known function of time, i.e. as long as the interest rate is not stochastic.


The intuition is as follows: Assume spot and interest rate are positively correlated.

- if  the  interest  rate rises,  then the  spot  price is likely  rising as well \\(\implies \\) due to the daily setllement in the futures contract, money can be released from the margin account and be invested at a higher interest rate
- if  the  interest  rate falls,  then the  spot  price is likely  falling as well \\(\implies \\) due to the  daily settlement,  money needs to	be paid into the margin account, but this money can now be borrowed at a lower interest rate
- relative to  a  forward  contract,  which is not	affect by any of this, the futures contract  benefits  from  interest  rate movements,  and this raises the	futures price as compared to the forward price

If spot and interest rate are negatively correlated, the opposite effect occurs, which lowers the	futures price relative to the forward price.

However, the theoretical differences between forward and futures prices for contracts that last only a few months are in most circumstances sufficiently small to	be ignored.	In **Hull** (2015),  for  most purposes it	is reasonable to assume that forward  and futures prices  are the	same.
