## 1. What is Investment?
什么是投资？

<br>

Investment refers to accumulation of means of production. Means of production is any input such as physical capital and/or labor that can be transformed to output.

投资指的是生产资料的积累。生产资料是任何可以被转化为产出的投入，比如说实体资本以及/或者劳动力。

<!-- Investments are thus desired changes in capital.

因此，投资是（预期资本变动？）。 -->

We focus mainly on physical capital in this section so that investments refer to physical investments. In National Accounts, physical investment is the construction both of residential and nonresidential buildings, as well as equipment (machines, computers, etc.) and durable goods (cars, furnitures, etc.).

我们在这一节主要地关注实体资本，所以投资指代的是实物投资。在国民经济核算中，实物投资是指住宅和非住宅建筑的建设，设备（机器、计算机等）和耐用品（汽车、家具等）。

Modern economies undertake very large investments that do not only take the form of physical machinery. Firms invest in R&D and in employees through training, they also invest through advertising in brand names and recognition to build up a customer base, etc. Investment can also be on housing or residential assets. Investment refers broadly to all kind of choices which have a cost today and an uncertain benet in the future.

现代经济实体从事着巨大的投资，它们不仅是以实体的器具的形式进行的。公司投资于研发和在员工的培训上，他们也投资品牌及其知名度的广告以构建用户基础等等。 投资也可以是住房或者住宅资产。广义上的投资是指当前存在成本且未来收益不确定的各种选择。

Investment is highly volatile, which is around 3-4% more volatile than GDP. Small changes in GDP usually cause big changes in Investment.

投资是高度地波动的，比国内生产总值的波动性大3-4%。国民生产总值中的微小的改变通常会导致投资中的巨大变化。
