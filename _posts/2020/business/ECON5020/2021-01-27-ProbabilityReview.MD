**Outline**




## 1. Discrete Random Variables  

**1.1 Sample Space**

- We collect the possible states of the world and denote the set by \\( \Omega \\).
The states are called **samples** or **elementary events**.


- The sample space \\( \Omega \\) is either **countable** or **uncountable**.
    -  A toss of a coin: \\( \Omega = \\lbrace Head, Tail \\rbrace = {H, T}.  \\)
    - The number of successes in a sequence of *n* identical and independent trials: \\( \Omega = \\lbrace 0, 1, . . . , n \\rbrace \\).
    - The moment of occurrence of the first success in an infinite sequence of identical and independent trials: \\( \Omega = \\lbrace 1, 2. . . \\rbrace \\).
    - The lifetime of a light bulb: \\( \Omega = \\lbrace x \\in R|x \\geq 0  \\rbrace \\).

- The choice of a sample space is arbitrary and thus any set can be
taken as a sample space. However, practical considerations justify the
choice of the most convenient sample space for the problem at hand.
Discrete (finite or infinite, but countable) sample spaces are easier to
handle than general sample spaces.

**1.2 Discrete Random Variables**

Examples of random variables:
I Prices of stocks.
I Exchange rates.
I Payo¤s corresponding to portfolios.


**Probability Measure**


**Probability Measure on a Discrete Sample Space**


**Example: Coin Flipping**



## 2 Expectation of a Random Variable  

- Note that the expectation of a random variable can be seen as the weighted average.

- Since it is impossible to know the exact event in the future,
expectation could help one to make decisions.
