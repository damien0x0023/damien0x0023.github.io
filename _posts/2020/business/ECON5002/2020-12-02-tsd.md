#  Basic Econometrics - Unit 6 Basic Regression Analysis with Time Series

## The nature of time series data

-   Temporal ordering of observations; may not be arbitrarily reordered
Typical features: serial correlation/dependence of observations
How should we think about the randomness in time series data?
-   The outcome of economic variables (e.g. GNP, Dow Jones) is uncertain; they should therefore be modeled as random variables
-   Time series are sequences of r.v. (= stochastic processes)
-   "Sample" = the one realized path of the time series out of the many possible paths the stochastic process could have taken

##  Examples of time series regression models

-   **Static models**

    -   In static time series models, the current value of one variable is modeled as the result of the current values of explanatory variables

-   **Examples for static models**

-   **Finite distributed lag models**
    -   In finite distributed lag models, the explanatory variables are allowed to influence the dependent variable with a time lag

-   **Example for a finite distributed lag model**
    -   The fertility rate may depend on the tax value of a child, but for biological and behavioral reasons, the effect may have a lag

##   <u><font color=red>Finite sample</font> properties of OLS under classical assumptions</u>

-   **Assumption TS.1 (Linear in parameters)**

![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2020/ECON5002/linearPara.png "Linear in parameters")

-   **Assumption TS.2 (No perfect collinearity)**

"In the sample (and therefore in the underlying time series process), no independent variable is constant nor a perfect linear combination of the others."

-   **Notion**

-   **Assumption TS.3 (Zero conditional mean)**

$$
    E(u _t | X) = 0 \quad t = 1,2, \cdots, n
$$

-   **Discussion of assumption TS.3**

![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2020/ECON5002/ts3.png "Assumption TS.3")

-   (Contemporaneous) Exogeneity is not enough to ensure unbiasdness.

-   TS.3 rules out <u>feedback</u> from the dep. variable on future values of the explanatory variables; \\( y _{t-j}, j >0 \\) cannot be included as regressors.

    -   \\( mrdrte _t = \beta _0 + \beta _1 polpc _t + \beta _2 mrdrte _{t-1} + u _t = \beta _0 + \beta _1 x _{1,t} + \beta _2 x _{2,t} + u _t \\)

    -   \\( E(u _t | x _{2, t+1}) \neq 0 \\)

- **Example (inflation and federal fund rate)**

    -   \\( inf _t = \beta _0 + \beta _1 ffrate _t + \beta _1 ffrate _{t-1} + \beta _2 ffrate _{t-2} + u _t .\\)

    -   \\( u _t >0 \\) might lead FED to increase the \\( ffrate \\) the next period. Then \\( ffrate _{t+1}\\) and \\( u _t \\)  are correlated, violating strict exogeneity.

- **<u>Theorem 10.1 (Unbiasedness of OLS)</u>**

$$
    TS.1 - TS.3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E(\hat{\beta} _j) = \beta _j, \quad j = 0,1, \cdots, k
$$

-   **Assumption TS.4 (Homoscedasticity)**


    -   A sufficient condition is that the volatility of the error is independent of the explanatory variables and that it is constant over time.
    -   In the time series context, homoscedasticity may also be easily violated, e.g. if the volatility of the dep. variable depends on regime changes.

-   **Assumption TS.5 (No serial correlation)**

![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2020/ECON5002/ts5.png "Assumption TS.5")

-   **Discussion of assumption TS.5**

    -   Why was such an assumption not made in the cross-sectional case?
    -   When \\(Corr(u _t, u _s) \neq 0\\) for some \\(ùë°‚â†ùë† \\), we say that the error exibith serial correlation (autocorrelation)
    -   Three types of correlation:

    $$
        1) Corr(x _{jt}, x _{hs}), \quad 
        2) Corr(x _{js}, u _t), \quad
        3) Corr(u _t, u _s)
    $$

-   **<u>Theorem 10.2 (OLS sampling variances)</u>**

![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2020/ECON5002/olsSampling.png "OLS sampling variances")

-   **<u>Theorem 10.3 (Unbiased estimation of the error variance)</u>**

$$
    TS.1 - TS.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad E(\hat{\sigma} ^2) = \sigma ^2
$$

-   **<u>Theorem 10.4 (Gauss-Markov Theorem)</u>**
    -   Under assumptions TS.1‚ÄìTS.5, the OLS estimators have the minimal variance of all linear unbiased estimators of the regression coefficients
    -   This holds conditional as well as unconditional on the regressors

-   **Assumption TS.6 (Normality)</u>**

    $$
        u _t \sim \text{iid} \ N(0, \sigma ^2) \quad \text{ indenpent of } X
    $$

This assumption implies TS.3 - TS.5.

-   **<u>Theorem 10.5 (Normal sampling distributions)</u>**

    -   Under assumptions TS.1 ‚Äì TS.6, the OLS estimators have the usual nor-mal distribution (conditional on X ). The usual F-and t-tests are valid.

-   **Using dummy explanatory variables in time series**

    -   Period: 1913-1984
    -   During World War II, the fertility rate was temporarily lower
    -   It has been permanently lower since the introduction of the pill in 1963

-   If we assume that the full set of CLM assumptions hold, we can reject \\( H _0: \beta _{pe} = 0\\) against the two-sided alternative at less than the 1% significance level \\(( t _{pe} = 2.77 )\\)
-   The estimated effect is practically large (probably too large). A $100 increase in \\(pe \\) increases the estimated fertility rate by 8.3 children per thousand women.
-   Fertility rates were much lover, on average, during WWII and after the introduction of the birth control pill.

## <u>Trends and Seasonality</u>

-   **Characterizing Trending Data**
    -   Many series tend to increase over time, at least on average. They typically have up and down periods, but the overall trend is up. (Example: GDP)
    -   Other variables tend to decline over time (such as the rate of traffic fatalities).
    -   We can find spurious relations among trending variables that have nothing to do with each other.

-   <u>Time series with trends</u>

-   **Modelling a linear <u>time</u> trend**

-   **Modelling an exponential <u>time</u> trend**

-   Example for a time series with an exponential trend

-   **Using trending variables in regression analysis**
    -   If trending variables are regressed on each other, a spurious relationship may arise just because they grows over time
    -   In this case, it is important to include a trend in the regression

-   Example: Housing investment and prices
