This will be a series of reading notes generated by Damien when learning the course ***Investment, Finance and Asset Price***. This post is the first note for the section Investment.  
这将是damien在学习课程《投资，金融与资产定价》的时候的一个读书笔记的系列。这篇博客是投资这个单元的第一篇笔记。

## 1. Define Investment

Investment refers to accumulation of means of production. Means of production is any input such as physical capital and/or labor that can be transformed to output.  
投资指的是生产资料的积累。生产资料是任何可以被转化为产出的投入，比如说实体资本以及/或者劳动力。

<!-- Investments are thus desired changes in capital.

因此，投资是（预期资本变动？）。 -->

We focus mainly on physical capital in this section so that investments refer to physical investments. In National Accounts, physical investment is the construction both of residential and nonresidential buildings, as well as equipment (machines, computers, etc.) and durable goods (cars, furnitures, etc.).  
我们在这一节主要地关注实体资本，所以投资指代的是实物投资。在国民经济核算中，实物投资是指住宅和非住宅建筑的建设，设备（机器、计算机等）和耐用品（汽车、家具等）。

Modern economies undertake very large investments that do not only take the form of physical machinery. Firms invest in R&D and in employees through training, they also invest through advertising in brand names and recognition to build up a customer base, etc. Investment can also be on housing or residential assets. Investment refers broadly to all kind of choices which have a cost today and an uncertain benefit in the future.  
现代经济实体从事着巨大的投资，它们不仅是以实体的器具的形式进行的。公司投资于研发和在员工的培训上，他们也投资品牌及其知名度的广告以构建用户基础等等。 投资也可以是住房或者住宅资产。广义上的投资是指当前存在成本且未来收益不确定的各种选择。

Investment is highly volatile, which is around 3-4% more volatile than GDP. Small changes in GDP usually cause big changes in Investment.

投资是高度地波动的，比国内生产总值的波动性大3-4%。国民生产总值中的微小的改变通常会导致投资中的巨大变化。

## 2. Some empirical facts on investments 
投资上的一些经验事实

These statistics are for the whole aggregate economy. To properly understand the behavior and determinants of aggregate investment, we need to study investment at the **firm/business level**.  
&emsp;&emsp;这些统计数据是针对整个总体的经济。为了正确理解总投资的行为和决定因素，我们需要研究企业/商业层面的投资。

![The share of firms by employment size of firms in the U.S.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/business/share_by_employment_size.png "The share of firms by employment size of firms in the U.S.")

Accoding to the Census from DB Global Markets Research, the total number of firms (public + private) in the US is around 5-6 million. 90% of these firms have less than 20 employees. Besides, the number of public listed firms have been declining while substantial entry and exit of firms.  
&emsp;&emsp;根据DB Global Markets Research的普查，美国的（公立和私立的）公司的总数大约是500-600万。百分之九十的拥有不足20名员工。此外，上市公司的数量一直在下降，而大量的公司上市和退市。

## 3. How do firms choose Investment?
公司如何选择投资？

Investment has both benefits and costs. Benefits are that more investment means more capital and more capital means more production and profits. The cost of buying and using new capital cannot be ignored. Optimal Investment shoud therefore compare the marginal benefit of new capital vesus the marginal cost of installing this capital.  
&emsp;&emsp;投资有收益也有成本。收益是指越多的投资意味着越多的资本，越多的资本意味着越多的生产和利润。购买和使用新资本的成本也不可以忽视。因此，最优的投资应将新资本的边际效益与安置该资本的边际成本相比较。

We will start with a two-period investment model. Consider the problem of a firm that lives for only two periods. The firm starts with capital \\(K_1\\) in the beginning of period 1 and it has to decide on how much to invest in period 1.  
&emsp;&emsp;我们将从一个连个周期的投资模型开始。我们将从两个时期的投资模式开始。考虑一个只存在两个时期的公司的问题。公司在第1期的开始时从资本 \\(K_1\\) 开始，它必须决定在第1期投资多少。

The cost of \\(I_1\\) units of investments is \\(P_1^K\\) · \\(I_1\\), where \\(P_1^K\\) is the price of a unit of capital. The stock of capital in the second period depends on the depreciation rate \\(\delta\\) and the level of investments today \\(I_1\\).     
&emsp;&emsp; \\(I_1\\) 单位的投资的成本是 \\(P_1^K\\) · \\(I_1\\)，其中 \\(P_1^K\\) 是单位资本的价格。第二阶段的资本存量取决于折旧率 \\(\delta\\) 和当前投资水平 \\(I_1\\)。

The second period capital is given by:  

$$
K_2 = (1 - \delta)K_1 + I_1 
\tag{1} \label{capital_accumulation}
$$

<!-- \eqref{capital_accumulation} -->

![Model Timeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/business/timeline.png "The timeline for the firm in this two-period model")

The timing should be read as follows:
1. \\(t = 0\\) is beginning of period 1,
2. \\(t = 1\\) is end of period 1 or beginning of period 2 and
3. \\(t = 2\\) is end of period 2.  

Investment has one period delay, that is, if you choose \\(I\\) units of investment now, you can use it for production only in the next period. The value of the firm is maximized at \\(t = 0\\), which means future period values should be discounted to present value.

An amount of money today is worth more than the same amount in the future. 1$ today is worth \\((1 + r )\\)$ one period from now and \\((1 + r )^2\\)$ two periods from now, where \\(r\\) is the interest rate.
Present Value is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash ows given some return. In general,

$$
\text{Present Value} = \frac{\text{Future Value}}{(1+r)^2} \ ,
$$  

&emsp;&emsp;where \\(r\\) is the interest rate of return and \\(n\\) is the number of periods.

The firm then uses this capital for production in period 2 and at the end of the period sells off the remaining capital at price \\(P^K_2\\) . The operating profit made by the firm each period is given by:   

$$
\pi(K_i)=\max_{L}\{F(K,L)-wL\},\ where\ i = \{1,2\} \ ,
\tag{2} \label{operatingProfit}
$$  

where you are maximizing revenue net of labor costs given by the wage, \\(w\\), times \\(L\\) the labor units. function \\(F(.)\\) is the production function that is concave and it represents the total output produced by the firm using both capital and labor inputs. By assuming that the price of output is one, this is also the revenue.

A production function is a technology that transforms inputs to output. 

$$
Output = f(Input_1, Input_2, ...Input_n).
$$

An example is a Cobb-Douglas production funciton:  

$$
f(K,L)=K^\alpha L^{1-\alpha}\ ,
$$  

&emsp;&emsp;where \\(\alpha\\) is a parameter that usually takes the value 1/3.

First derivative with respect to inputs is called the marginal product:  

$$
\text{Marginal Product of Capital} (MPK) = \frac{\partial f(K,L)}{\partial K}
$$  

$$
\text{Marginal Product of Labor} (MPL) = \frac{\partial f(K,L)}{\partial L}
$$  

&emsp;&emsp; **Note**: Operating profits is the maximum value given by the solution to eq. \eqref{operatingProfit}.

For this, we need to take the First Order Condition (FOC) with reference to (w.r.t or WRT) \\(L_i\\):  

$$
\frac{\partial F(K_i,\ L_i)}{\partial L_i} - w = 0
$$  

Optimal units of labor is such that the marginal product of labor equals the wage rate.
The solution of this FOC gives us our optimal labor \\(L_i^\*\\). The value of profits at \\(L_i^\*\\) gives us the maximum value of profis, \\(\pi(K_i)\\) for both periods \\(i = 1, 2\\).

All profits left after accounting for costs are distributed as dividends to the shareholders. Dividend at each period is given by the operating prots net of investment costs. Dividends for period 1 is:  

$$
D_1 = \pi(K_1) - I_1 P^K_1 
\tag{3}\label{divident1}
$$  

and for period 2 is given by:  

$$
D_2 = \pi(K_2) - I_2 P^K_2
$$  

&emsp;&emsp;as the firm sells off any left over capital at the end of period 2. **Note**: The firm only lives for two periods, so capital at time 3 is zero:

$$
\because\ K_3 = (1-\delta) K_2 + I_2 = 0
$$  

$$
\implies\ I_2 = -\ (1-\delta) K_2
$$  

&emsp;&emsp; Take the above eq. \\( I_2 = -\ (1-\delta) K_2 \\) into eq. \\( D_2 =\pi(K_2) -I_2 P^K_2 \\) , now dividends at time 2 is given by:  

$$
\begin{align}
    \therefore\ 
    D_2 & = \pi(K_2) -I_2 P^K_2 \\\\
    & = \pi(K_2) + (1 - \delta) P^K_2 K_2  \\\\
\end{align}
\tag{4} \label{divident2}
$$

The main objective of the firm is to maximize the shareholder wealth or in other words, the present discounted sum of dividends: 

$$
\max_{I_1} \left \\{
     D_1 + \frac{1}{1+r} D_2 
     \right \\} 
\tag{5} \label{discountedSum1}
$$  

The discounting is done using the real interest rate, \\(r\\) . We need to discount as dividends received in the future is worth less than current dividends. Substitute \\(D_1\\), \\(D_2\\) with eq. \eqref{divident1}, \eqref{divident2} here, eq. \eqref{discountedSum1} can be rewritten as:  

$$
\max_{I_1} \left \\{ 
    \pi(K_1) - I_1 P^K_1  + \frac{1}{1+r} \left [ 
            \pi(K_2) + 
            (1 - \delta) P^K_2 K_2 
        \right ] 
    \right \\} 
\tag{6} \label{discountedSum2}
$$  

To solve this optimization problem, substitute \\(K_2\\) from eq. \eqref{capital_accumulation} \\(K_2 = (1 - \delta)K_1 + I_1 \\) in eq. \eqref{discountedSum2}:

$$
\max_{I_1} \left \\{ 
    \pi(K_1) - I_1 P^K_1  + \frac{1}{1+r} \left [ 
        \pi ( (1 - \delta) K_1 + I_1 ) + 
        (1 - \delta) P^K_2 ( (1 - \delta) K_1 + I_1)
        \right ] 
    \right \\} 
\tag{7} \label{discountedSum3}
$$  

Now take the derivative w.r.t \\(I_1\\) to eq. \eqref{discountedSum3} and equate it to zero:  

$$
-\ P^K_1 + \frac{1}{1+r} \left( 
        \frac {\partial \pi(K_2)} {\partial I_2} +
        (1 - \delta) P^K_2 
    \right) = 0
$$

&emsp;&emsp;Note that \\(\pi (K_2)\\) is an implicit function of investment, so we have to use the chain rule.  

$$
\frac{\partial \pi(K_2)}{\partial I_1} = 
\frac{\partial \pi(K_2)}{\partial K_2} \frac{\partial K_2}{\partial I_1} = 
\frac{\partial \pi(K_2)}{\partial K_2} · \frac{\partial [(1 - \delta)K_1 + I_1]}{\partial I_1} = 
\frac{\partial \pi(K_2)}{\partial K_2} · (1)
\tag{8} \label{derivative}
$$ 

We denote the partial derivative w.r.t capital as \\(\pi_K(K_2)\\) (=\\(\frac{\partial \pi(K_2)}{\partial K_2}  \\)), which is the marginal product of capital. To solve this optimization problem , we need to get the first order condition. The first order condition (F.O.C) with respect to investment at time 1, \\(I_1\\), the eq. \eqref{derivative} can be rewrited as:

$$  
P^K_1 = \frac{1}{1+r} \left ( 
        \pi_K(K_2) + (1 - \delta) P^K_2 
    \right)
\tag{9} \label{price1}
$$  

&emsp;&emsp; or:  

$$
\pi_K(K_2) = (1+r) P^K_1 - (1 - \delta) P^K_2 
\tag{10} \label{partialDerivative}
$$  

A firm should invest in capital until the value of the extra output that capital produces falls to equal the user cost.  
that is:  

$$
Marginal\ Product\ of\ Capital\ (MPK)\ =\ User\ Cost\ of\ Capital
\tag{11} \label{MPKuserCost}
$$  

The left-hand side is the marginal profitability of capital; due to law of diminishing returns ( \\(F\\) is concave), it is decreasing in \\(K_2\\).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/business/MPKbyK.png "Output/MPK")

The right hand side is what is called the user cost of capital, and reects the total cost to hiring one more unit of capital in period 2. It depends on the interest rate \\(r\\), the depreciation rate \\(\delta\\), and the price of capital today (when you buy it) and tomorrow (when you sell it).

Special Case: If the price of capital is constant \\(P^K_1 = P^K_2 = P^K \\), then  

$$
\pi_K(K2) = (r + \delta) P^K 
\tag{13} \label{specialCase}
$$

The cost of using one unit of capital \\(\pi_K(K_2)\\) is the loss of interest foregone by buying a machine instead of saving the money \\(r P^K\\), plus the depreciation (maintenance) cost of capital \\(\delta P^K\\).

Optimal investment decisions can also be reasoned by no arbitrage condition. 

**No Arbitrage**: If an investor is maximizing profits, then the two investments must yield the same return.
Why? Consider an investor faced with two different investment projects.  If one of the projects yielded a higher return, then the investor would not be maximing profits since he/she can always allocate more investment towards the high return activity and get more profits.

In our model, the firm manager had two options: 
1. **Invest** one unit of capital and get returns given by the \\[ Marginal Product of Capital + Capital Gains - Depreciation
Cost\\]
2. **Not Invest** and get returns by depositing the money in the bank. 

For profit maximization, both activities should yield the same return by no arbitrage condition. Rearranging gives us the same solution as in eq. \eqref{partialDerivative}.

$$
\underbrace{r P^K_1}_{\text{Net Return from Bank}} = MPK + \underbrace{(P^K_2 - P^K_1)}\_{\text{Capital Gains}} - \underbrace{\delta P^K_2}\_{\text{Depreciation Cost}}
$$

Aritrage arguments can also be used as a way to easily understand the impact of policies on investment.

Example: How does an increase in the corporate tax rate impact investment?
An increase in tax rate means that the firm has to pay an additional amount as taxes from its marginal product of capital. Denoting the tax rate by  , the no arbitrage condition can be
written as:  

$$
r P^K_1 = \underbrace{(1-\tau)MPK}_{\text{Net Return after taxes}} + (P^K_2 - P^K_1) - \delta P^K_2
$$  

The tax rate essentially increases the user cost of capital. 
 
$$
MPK = \frac{r P^K_1 - (P^K_2 - P^K_1) + \delta P^K_2} {1- \tau}
$$

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/business/MPK_K.png "MPK by K with and without tax")

This model is also called the user cost model and is useful to understand long-run capital accumulation and the effect of tax policies but abstracts from many realistic features.

An implication of the model is that the capital stock will adjust very quickly whenever \\(r\\) or \\(\delta \\) change. In other words, this model predicts that investment will be
very smooth contradicting the data. If there are no costs of building a factory, then even infinite rates of investments is theoretically possible!

In reality firms do not respond so fast because there are impediments to adjustment. Furthermore, decision of the firm are not static but forward looking.  
Current investment decisions are also based on **expectations** of future profits. Firms' expand their capital stocks when they expect their sales to grow and cost of capital to be low and contract them when when they expext their sales to fall and the cost of
capital to be high.  
These facts motivated the development of the adjustment cost model, also known as Tobin's Q model which is the benchmark model in this literature.
