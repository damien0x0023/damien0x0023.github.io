# Unit 5 Multi Period Market Model 
多期市场模型  

## Overview
- One-period models
  - Elementary market model
  - Single-period market model
- Multi-period market model
  - Role of Information
  - Can we 'split' into many single-period models?  

### Elementary Market Model
- 2 states of nature
- 2 assets: riskless bank account (governemnt bond) and an 'underlying asset' - risky share
- The aim is to replicate particular contingent claim: form a portfolio of two assets which will give you exactly the same payoff as the contingent claim.
- Important notions are introduced
  - arbitrage
  - risk neutral probability measure (RNPM)
- We show that the replicating strategy (portfolio weights) is fully explained by RNPM
- In the elementary model there is a simple formula to compute RNPM.
- If there is no arbitrage you can *always* find RNPM and construct replicating strategy.
  - you can guess this is because there are two states of nature and two assets  

  ### Single-Period Market Model
- \\(K \geq 2\\) states of nature. We work with finite K. 
- \\(N \geq 2\\) risky assets and one riskless bank account (governemnt bond). So *N + 1* securities in portfolio.
- The aim is the same: replicate particular contingent claim by forming a portfolio of assets which will give you exactly the same payoff as the contingent claim. Important notions are introduced.
  - arbitrage
  - risk neutral probability measure (RNPM)
  - complete market model
  - attainable claim  

- FATP: Model \\(\cal M\\) is arbitrage free \\((\Leftrightarrow)\\)at least one RNPM exists.
  - Need a procedure to find RNPM. If we can construct a RNPM then there is no arbitrage. We discussed the procedure.
  - If we know RNPM we can use it to construct the replicating strategy.
  - If we have a replicating strategy then the contingent claim is attainable.
- Complete market: all contingent claims are attainable.
- Need to have at least as many (different) securities (*N + 1*) as (different) states of nature (*K*).
- So, we are naturally interested in working with complete markets. There is a unique RNPM there. And we learned how to construct a replicating portfolio and so we learned how to find an arbitrage price of a contingent claim.
- However, when markets are incomplete, then certain claims can still be attainable.  

 ### Multi-Period Market Model
- Many (possibly infinite number of) periods.
- \\(K \geq 2\\) states of nature.
- \\(N \geq 2\\) risky assets and one riskless bank account (governemnt bond). So *N + 1* securities in portfolio.
- Unlike in single-period models, information at each period changes.
- We discussed ho to model the information set (partitions and filtrations). When computing expectations at period t they are now conditional on 'information available at time *t*', not 'the whole information'.  

**Outline**
We will examine the following issues:  
1 Trading Strategies and Arbitrage-Free Models  
2 Risk-Neutral Probability Measures and Martingales  
3 Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing  
4 Arbitrage Pricing of Attainable Claims  
5 Risk-Neutral Valuation of Non-Attainable Claims  
6 Completeness of Multi-Period Market Models  

## 1 Trading Strategies and Arbitrage-Free Models
### Primary Traded Assets
To specify a **multi-period market model** \\(\cal M= (B, S^1, . . . , S^n)\\)
we have to examine the concept of a dynamic trading strategy and the associated wealth process.
We first define **primary traded assets**  
- Let *r* be the interest rate. The **money market account** is denoted by \\(B_t\\) for t = 0, 1,... ,T where  

$$
B_t = (1 + r )^t  
$$
- There are n risky assets, called **stocks**, with price processes denoted
by \\(S_t^j\\) for t = 0, 1,...,T.
- We are given a probability space \\((\Omega,\cal F,\mathbb P)\\) endowed with a filtration \\(\mathbb F\\) generated by price processes of stocks.  


### Dynamic Trading Strategy and Wealth Process  

A dynamic **trading strategy** in a multi-period market model is defined as a stochastic process \\((\phi_t =\phi_t^0,\phi_t^1,...,\phi_t^n)\\) for t = 0, 1, . . . ,*T* where:
- \\(\phi_t^0\\) is the number of 'shares' of the money market account *B* held at time *t*.
- \\(\phi_t^j\\)is the number of shares of the *j*th stock held at time *t*.  

#### Definition (Value Process)
The **wealth process** (or **value process**) of a trading strategy \\((\phi =\phi^0,\phi^1,...,\phi^n)\\) is the stochastic process \\(V (\phi)\\) given by  

$$  
V_t (\phi) = \phi_t^0 B_t + \Sigma _{j=1}^n \phi_t^j S_t^j .
$$

### Self-Financing Trading Strategy  

#### Definition (Self-Financing Trading Strategy)  

A trading strategy \\(\phi\\) is said to be **self-financing strategy** if for t = 0, 1, . . . ,*T - 1*,  
$$
\phi_t^0 B_{t+1} + \Sigma_{j=1}^n S_{t+1}^j = \phi_{t+1}^0 B_{t+1} + \Sigma_{j=1}^n S_{t+1}^j
$$
- The LHS of (1) represents the value of the portfolio at time t + 1 before its revision, whereas the RHS represents the value at time t + 1 after the portfolio was revised.
- Condition (1) says that these two values must be equal and this means that no cash was withdrawn or added.
- For t = T - 1, both sides of (1) represent the wealth at time T, that is,\\(V_T(\phi)\\). We do not revise the portfolio at time T.  

### Gains Process
#### Lemma (6.1)
For any self-financing trading strategy, the wealth process can be alternatively computed by, for t = 1, . . . ,T,   
 
$$
V_t (\phi) = \phi_t^0 B_t + \Sigma_{j=1}^n \phi_{t-1}^j S_t^j  
$$
#### Proof.
The statement is an immediate consequence of formula (1).
#### Definition (Gains Process)
For a trading strategy \\(\phi\\), the **gains process** \\(G(\phi) = (G_t (\phi))_{0 \leq t \leq T}\\) is given by  

$$
G_t (\phi) := (V_t (\phi)) - V_0(\phi).
$$

### Multi-Period Market Model
#### Definition (Market Model)
A multi-period market model \\(\cal M= (B, S^1, . . . , S^n)\\) is given by the following data:  
1. A probability space \\((\Omega,\cal F,\mathbb P)\\) endowed with a filtration
\\(\mathbb F= (\cal F_t)_{0 \leq t \leq T}\\) .
2. The money market account B given by \\(B_t = (1 + r )^t\\) .
3. A number of financial assets with prices \\(S^1, . . . , S^n\\), which are assumed to be \\(\mathbb F\\)-adapted stochastic processes.
4. The class F of all self-financing trading strategies. 

### Increment Processes
- As in the single-period model, we define the discounted value process, gains process and discounted gains process.
- It will be convenient to use the increment processes for traded assets.  

#### Definition (Increment Processes)
- The **increment process** \\(\Delta S^j\\) corresponding to the jth stock is deined by  

$$
\Delta S_{t+1}^j := S_{t+1}^j - S_t^j &emsp;&emsp;for&emsp;&emsp; t = 0, . . . ,T - 1  
$$  

- The **increment proces**s \\(\Delta B\\) of the money market account are given by  

$$
\Delta B_{t+1} := B_{t+1} - B_t = (1 + r )^t r = B_t r &emsp;&emsp;for&emsp;&emsp; t = 0, . . . ,T - 1.  
$$  

### Discounted Processes
#### Definition (Discounted Processes)
The discounted stock prices are given by  

$$ 
\hat S_t^j:= \frac {S_t^j}{B_t}  
$$
and the increments of discounted prices are \\(\Delta \hat S_{t+1}^j := \hat S_t^j\\). The discounted wealth process \\(\hat V (\phi)\\) of \\(\phi\\) is given by  
$$
\hat V_t (\phi) :=\frac {V_t(\phi)}{B_t}  
$$  

The discounted gains process \\(\hat G (\phi)\\) of \\(\phi\\) equals  

$$
\hat G_t (\phi) := \hat V_t (\phi) - \hat V_0(\phi).  
$$
  

Discounted Processes
#### Proposition (6.1)
An \\(\mathbb F\\)-adapted trading strategy \\(phi = (\phi_t)_{0 \leq t \leq T} \\ is self-financing if and only if any of the two equivalent statements hold:
1. for every t = 1, . . . ,T  

$$
G_t (\phi) =\Sigma_{u=0}^{t-1} \phi_u^0 \delta G_{u+1} + \Sigma_{u=0}^{t-1} \Sigma_{j=1}^n \phi_u^j \Delta \hat S_{u+1}^j  
$$

2. for every t = 1, . . . ,T  

$$
\hat G_t (\phi) =\Sigma_{u=0}^{t-1} \Sigma_{j=1}^n \phi_u^j \Delta \hat S_{u+1}^j  
$$  

### Properties of Discounted Gains and Wealth
#### Proof.
[Proof of Proposition 6.1] The proof is elementary and thus it is left as an exercise.
- Note that the process \\(\hat G (\phi)\\) given by condition 2) does not depend on
the component \\(\phi^0\\) of \\(\phi \in \Phi\\).
- In view of Proposition 6.1, the discounted wealth process of any \\(\phi \in \Phi\\) satifies  

$$
\hat V_t(\phi)=\hat V_0(\phi) + \Sigma_{u=0}^{t-1} \Sigma_{j=1}^n \phi_u^j \Delta \hat S_{u+1}^j  
$$

- Hence for every t = 0, . . . ,T - 1  

$$
\Delta \hat V_{t+1}(\phi)= \Delta \hat G_{t+1}(\phi) =\Sigma_{j=1}^n \phi_t^j \Delta \hat S_{t+1}^j
$$

### Arbitrage Opportunity
As usual, we work under the standing assumption that the sample space \\(\Omega\\) is finite (or countable).
#### Definition (Arbitrage Opportunity)
A trading strategy \\(\phi = (\phi_t)_{0 \leq t \leq T} \\) is an **arbitrage opportunity** if
1. \\(V_0(\phi) = 0\\),
2. \\(V_T (\phi)(\omega) \geq\ 0 \\) for all \\(\omega \in \Omega\\),
3. \\(V_T (\phi)(w) > 0 \\) for some \\(\omega \in \Omega\\\) or, equivalently, \\(\mathbb E_P(V_T (\phi)) > 0\\).  
We say that a multi-period market model \\(\cal M\\) is arbitrage-free if no arbitrage opportunities exist in \\(\Phi\\).


### Arbitrage Conditions
- Note that in the arbitrage conditions one can use either the discounted wealth process \\(\hat V\\) or the discounted gains process \\(\hat G\\) (instead of the wealth V).
- It is also important to note that conditions 1)-3) hold under \\(\mathbb P\\)
whenever they are satisfied under some probability measure \\(\mathbb Q\\) - equivalent to \\(\mathbb P\\).
- The next step is to introduce the concept of a risk-neutral probability measure for a multi-period market model.
- Risk-neutral probability measures are very closely related to the question of arbitrage-free property and completeness of a multi-period market model.



## 2 Risk-Neutral Probability Measures and Martingales  

### Risk-Neutral Probability Measure  
#### Definition (Risk-Neutral Probability Measure)  
A probability measure \\(\mathbb Q\\) on W is called a **risk-neutral probability
measure** for a multi-period market model \\(\cal M= (B, S^1, . . . , S^n)\\) whenever  
1.  \\(\mathbb Q(\omega) > 0 \\) for all \\(\omega \in \Omega\\),  
2.  \\(\mathbb E_P(\Delta \hat S_{t+1}^j) \| \cal F_t ) = 0\\) for all j = 1, . . . , n and t = 0, . . . ,T - 1.  

We denote by M the class of all risk-neutral probability measures for the market model \\(\cal M\\).  
Observe that condition 2) is equivalent to the equality, for all  

$$
(\mathbb E_P(\Delta \hat S_{t+1}^j) \| \cal F_t ) = \hat S_{t}^j
$$
The discounted stock price \\(\hat S^j\\) is a martingale under any risk-neutral probability measure \\(\mathbb Q \in \mathbb M\\).


### Discounted Wealth as a Martingale  
#### Proposition (6.2)  
Let \\(\phi \in \Phi\\) be a trading strategy. Then the discounted wealth process \\(\hat V(\phi0\\) and the discounted gains process \\(\hat G(\phi)\\) are martingales under any risk-neutral probability measure \\(\mathbb Q \in \mathbb M\\).

#### Proof.  
- Recall that \\(\hat V_t(\phi)\\) = \\(\hat V_0(\phi)\\) + \\(\hat G_t(\phi)\\)  for every t = 0, . . . ,T,
- Since \\(\hat V_0(\phi)\\) (the initial endowment) is a constant, it suffices to show that the process \\(\hat G_t(\phi)\\  is a martingale under any
 \\(\mathbb Q \in \mathbb M\\). From Proposition 6.1, we obtain  

$$
\hat G_{t+1}(\phi) = \hat G_t (\phi)+ \Sigma_{j=1}^n \phi_u^j \Delta \hat S_{u+1}^j  
$$
  

#### Proof of Proposition 6.2
Proof.
[Proof of Proposition 6.2 (Continued)]
- Hence  

!["FIG.1"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5020/MultiPeriodMarketModel/1.png "FIG.1")

- We used the fact that \\(\phi_t^j\\) is \\(\cal F_t\\)-measurable and the "take out what is known" property of the conditional expectation.
- We conclude that \\(\hat G (\phi)\\) is a martingale under any \\(\mathbb Q \in \mathbb M\\).  



## 3 Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing  

### Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing  

- We will show that the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing (FTAP) can be extended to a multi-period market model.
- Recall that the class of admissible trading strategies \\(\phi\\) in a multi-period market model is assumed to be the full set of all self-financing and \\(\mathbb F\\)-adapted trading strategies.
- It possible to show that in that case, the relationship between the existence of a risk-neutral probability measure \\(\mathbb Q\\) and no arbitrage for the model \\(\cal M\\) is "if and only if".
- We will only prove here the following implication:
Existence of \\(\mathbb Q \in \mathbb M\\)  \\(\rightarrow\\) Model \\(\cal M\\) is arbitrage-free.  

Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing
#### Theorem (FTAP)
Consider a multi-period market model \\(\cal M= (B, S^1, . . . , S^n)\\).  
The following statements hold:
1. if the class \\(\mathbb M\\) of risk-neutral probability measures for \\(\cal M\\)is non-empty then there are no arbitrage opportunities in the class F of all self-financing trading strategies and thus the model \\(\cal M\\) is arbitrage-free,
2. if there are no arbitrage opportunities in the class \\(\Phi\\) of all self-financing trading strategies then there exists a risk-neutral probability measure for \\(\cal M\\), so that the class \\(\mathbb M\\) is non-empty.  

To sum up:  
**Class \\(\mathbb M\\) is non-empty \\(\Longleftrightarrow\\) Market model \\(\cal M\\) is arbitrage-free**

### Proof of the FTAP \\((\Longrightarrow\\))  
#### Proof.  
[Proof of the FTAP \\((\Longrightarrow\\)) ] Let us assume that a risk-neutral probability measure \\(\mathbb Q\\) for \\(\cal M\\) exists.Our goal it to show that the model \\(\cal M\\) is arbitrage-free.  
To this end, we argue by contradiction. Let us thus assume that there exists an arbitrage opportunity \\(\phi \in \Phi\\). Such a strategy would satisfy the following conditions:  

1. the initial endowment \\(\hat V_0(\phi) = 0\\),
2. the discounted gains process \\(\hat G_T (\phi) \geq 0\\),
3. there exists at least one w 2 W such that \\(\hat G_T (\phi)(\omega) > 0\\).    

On the one hand, from conditions 2. and 3. above, we deduce easily that  

$$ 
\mathbb E_P(\hat G_T (\phi)) > 0
$$

Proof of the FTAP \\((\Longrightarrow\\))
Proof.
[Proof of the FTAP (\\(\Longrightarrow\\))] On the other hand, using Proposition 6.1, we obtain  

!["FIG.2"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5020/MultiPeriodMarketModel/2.png "FIG.2")  

This clearly contradicts the inequality obtained in the first step. Hence there cannot be an arbitrage in the market model \\(\cal M\\).  

### Replicating Strategy  

- Note that a contingent claim of European style can only be exercised at its maturity date T (as opposed to contingent claims of American style).
- A **European contingent claim** in a multi-period market model is an
\\(\cal F_T\\) -measurable random variable X on \\(\Omega\\) to be interpreted as the payoff at the terminal date T.  
一个欧式或有债权在多期的市场模式是一种  \\(\cal F_T\\)-可测量的随机变量 X 在 \\(\Omega\\) 上解释为截止日期 T 的收益。
- For brevity, European contingent claims will also be referred to as contingent claims or simply claims.  

#### Definition (Replicating Strategy)  
A replicating strategy (or a hedging strategy) for a contingent claim X is a trading strategy \\(\phi \in \Phi\\) such that \\(V_T(\phi) = X\\), that is, the terminal wealth of the trading strategy matches the claims payoff for all \\(\omega\\).  
或有债权 X 的复制策略（或对冲策略）是一种交易策略 \\(\phi \in \Phi\\)，使得 \\(V_T(\phi) = X\\)，即交易策略的最终财富与所有 \\(\omega\\)的债权收益相匹配。
 
### Principle of No-Arbitrage  

#### Definition (Principle of No-Arbitrage)  
An F-adapted stochastic process \\((\pi_t (X))_{0 \leq t \leq T}\\) is a price process for the contingent claim X that complies with the principle of no-arbitrage if there is no F-adapted and self-financing arbitrage strategy in the extended model \\(\cal \tilde M= (B, S^1, . . . , S^n, S^{n+1})\\) with an additional asset \\(S^{n+1}\\) given by  \\(S_T^{n+1}=\pi_t X\\) for  \\(0 \leq t \leq T-1\\) and \\(S_T^{n+1}=X\\)  

一个F-适应随机过程\\((\pi_t (X))_{0 \leq t \leq T}\\)是一个或有权益X的价格过程，如果扩展模型\\(\cal \tilde M= (B, S^1, . . . , S^n, S^{n+1})\\)中不存在 F-适应 和自筹资金的套利策略，则符合无套利原则，且附加资产\\(S^{n+1}\\)，由\\(0 \leq t \leq T-1\\)）和\\(S_T^{n+1}=X\\)给出。
- The standard method to price a contingent claim is to employ the replication principle, if it can be applied.  
对未定权益定价的标准方法是采用复制原则（如果适用的话
- The price will now depend on time t and thus one has to specify a whole price process \\(\pi(X)\\), rather than just an initial price, as in the single-period market model.   
-价格现在取决于时间t，因此必须指定一个完整的价格过程\\(\pi(X)\\)，而不是像单周期市场模型那样只指定一个初始价格。
- Obviously, \\(\pi_T(X)=X\\) for any claim X.  

## 4 Arbitrage Pricing of Attainable Claims  

### Arbitrage Pricing of Attainable Claims  

In the next result, we deal with an **attainable** claim, meaning that we
assume a priori that a replicating strategy for X exists.  

#### Proposition (6.3)  
Let X be a contingent claim in an arbitrage-free multi-period market model \\(\cal M\\) and let \\(\phi \in \Phi\\) be any replicating strategy for X. Then the only price process of X that complies with the principle of no-arbitrage is the wealth process \\(V (\phi)\\).
- The arbitrage price at time t of an attainable claim X is unique and it is also denoted as \\(\pi_t (X)\\).
- Hence the equality \\(\pi_t (X) = V_t (\phi)\\) holds for any replicating strategy \\(\phi \in \Phi\\) for X.
- In particular, the price at time t = 0 is the initial endowment of any replicating strategy for X, that is, \\(\pi_0 (X) = V_0 (\phi)\\) for any strategy  \\(\phi \in \Phi\\) such that \\(V_T (\phi) =X\\).  

### Example: Replication of a Digital Call Option  

- The definition of hedging strategy is also used to price a contingent claim, which is called the **replication principle**.
- We will now examine replication of a contingent claim in a two-period
market model.
- It is easy to check that this model is arbitrage-free.  
Example (6.1)  
- Consider a two-period market model consisting of the savings account and one risky stock.
- The interest rate equals \\(r=\frac{1}{9}\\) so that 

- The price of the stock is represented in the following exhibit in which
the real-world probability \\(\mathbb P\\) is also specified.

Summary of pricing and hedging results for a digital call option.  
Recall that the price at time t = 2 equals \\(pi_2(X) = X\\).  
Replicating strategy f satisfies \\(V_2(\phi) = X\\).  
The arbitrage price process of X equals \\(\pi_(X) = V (\phi)\\).

### Attainability of Contingent Claims and Completeness  

#### Definition (Attainable Contingent Claim)
A contingent claim X is called to be attainable if there exists a trading
strategy \\(\phi \in \Phi\\), which replicates X, i.e.,  \\(\pi_T(X)=X\\).  

- For attainable contingent claims, it is clear how to price them by the initial investment needed for a replicating strategy.  
- As in single period market models, for some contingent claims a hedging strategy may fail to exist.  

#### Definition (Completeness)  
A multi period market model is said to be **complete** if and only if all contingent claims have replicating strategies. If a multi period market model is not complete, it is said to be **incomplete**.  


## 5 Risk-Neutral Valuation of Non-Attainable Claims  

### Risk-Neutral Valuation Formula
#### Proposition (6.4)
Let X be a contingent claim (possibly non-attainable) and Q any
risk-neutral probability measure for the multi-period market model \\(\cal M\\).
Then the **risk-neutral valuation formula**   

defines a price process \\(\pi(X)= (\pi_t (X))_{0 \leq t \leq T}\\) for X that complies with the principle of no-arbitrage.  


#### Proof.  
The proof hinges the same arguments as in the single-period case and thus it is left as an exercise. If X is attainable then can also observe that \\(\hat V (\phi)\\) is a martingale under \\(\mathbb Q\\) and apply the defiition of a martingale.  


### Example: Risk-Neutral Valuation
!["FIG.11"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5020/MultiPeriodMarketModel/11.png "FIG.11") 

#### Example (6.2 Continued)
- Consider again the market model \\(\cal M= (B, S)\\) introduced in Example 6.1. Recall that the conditional probabilities describe the movements under the real-world probability \\(\mathbb P\\).
- Let \\(\mathbb Q\\) be a risk-neutral probability measure from M.
- We denote \\(q_i = \mathbb Q (\omega_i )\\) for i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
- By the definition of the risk-neutral probability, we have  

!["FIG.12"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5020/MultiPeriodMarketModel/12.png "FIG.12")

Example: Risk-Neutral Valuation  

Example (6.2 Continued)  
The price of the digital call option considered in Example 6.1 can be computed as follows.  

!["FIG.16"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5020/MultiPeriodMarketModel/16.png "FIG.16")

- These pricing results coincide with those obtained in Example 6.1, where we computed directly the wealth process \\(V (\phi)\\) of the replicating strategy \\(\phi\\) for X.  
- As indicated earlier, a multi-period market model \\(\cal M\\) can be decomposed into several single-period market models.

Example: Backward Induction  
#### Example (6.3 Continued)  
- We consider the market model in Example 6.1 once again.  
- The two-period market model is composed of the following single-period market models:
1. \\(S_1 = 1.5, S_2 = 3 and S_2 = 1\\).
2. \\(S_1 = 0.75, S_2 = 1.5 and S_2 = 0.5\\).
3. \\(S_0 = 1, S_1 = 1.5 and S_1 = 0.75\\).  
- Note that these models are elementary market models.  
- Hence the unique risk-neutral probability measures can be computed using the formula

Example: Backward Induction  
Example (6.3 Continued)  
- Recall that if the elementary market model is arbitrage-free then it is also complete and all contingent claims can be priced using the risk-neutral probability.
- In the first model, the risk neutral probability measure is

- Note that the unique risk-neutral probability measure Q in two-period market model can be recomputed as follows:

## 6 Completeness of Multi-Period Market Models  
### Completeness  

As a handy criterion for the market completeness, we have the theorem,which extends the known result for the single-period case.  
Theorem (6.1)  
Assume that a multi-period market model \\(\cal M= (B, S^1, . . . , S^n)\\) is arbitrage-free. Then \\(\cal\\) M is complete if and only if there is only one risk-neutral probability measure, that is, \\(\mathbb M = \\{\hat  P\\}\\)  is a singleton.  

In the context of a model decomposition, the following statements are known to hold:  
- If all single-period models which compose a multi-period model are arbitrage-free then the multi-period model is also arbitrage-free.
- If they are also complete then the multi-period model is also complete.
- The converse of the above statement is also correct.  

## Summary of Pricing and Hedging Approaches  

We examined three pricing and hedging approaches:  
1. The method based on the idea of replication of a contingent claim. It can
only be applied to attainable contingent claim in a complete or incomplete
model and it yields the hedging strategy and arbitrage price process.
2. The method relying on the concept of a risk-neutral probability, which can be applied in either a complete or incomplete model. It furnishes the unique arbitrage price process for any attainable claim and a possible arbitrage price process for a non-attainable contingent claim. In the latter case, the price process depends on the choice of a risk-neutral probability.
3. The backward induction approach in which a multi-period market model is decomposed into a family of single-period models. Pricing is performed in a recursive way starting from the date T 􀀀 1 and moving step-by-step towards the initial date 0. Hedging strategy can also be computed provided that the claim is attainable.
