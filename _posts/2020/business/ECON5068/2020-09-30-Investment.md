## What is Investment?
什么是投资？

Investment refers to accumulation of means of production. Means of production is any input such as physical capital and/or labor that can be transformed to output.Investments are thus desired changes in capital.

这里的投资指的是生产资料的积累。生产资料是任何可以被转化为产出的投入，比如说实体资本以及/或者劳动力。因此，投资是（预期资本变动？）。

We are focused mainly on physical capital and so investments refer to physical investments.

In National Accounts, physical investment is the construction both of residential and nonresidential buildings, as well as equipment (machines, computers, etc.) and durable goods (cars, furnitures, etc.).
