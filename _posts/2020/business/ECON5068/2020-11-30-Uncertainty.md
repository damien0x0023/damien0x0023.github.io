Frank Knight (1921) defines uncertainty as the agents’ inability to forecast the likelihood of events happening.
In other words, the distribution of outcomes is immeasurable (unknown).
It is different from Risk because risk only describes a known probability distribution over all possible events.
Example: Tossing a coin is risky while the total number of coins produced by mankind is uncertain.

Uncertainty is not directly observable, which makes it hard to measure.
There is no perfect measurement, but a broad range of proxies have been suggested.
The **volatility of stock market or GDP** is often used as a measure of uncertainty because when a data series becomes more volatile it is harder to forecast.

Another measure is **forecaster disagreement** which is the differences in opinion or expectations about how economic variables are going to evolve. High disagreement indicates high uncertainty.

Other measures include **mentions of “uncertainty”** in the news and the **dispersion of productivity shocks** to firms.

- Macro Uncertainty Rises in Recessions. 
- Micro Uncertainty Rises in Recessions.
- Wages and Income Volatility are Counter-Cyclical.
- Uncertainty is higher in developing countries.

## Investment

During periods of high uncertainty, we observe low investment spending.
This was the case during the short-lived 2001 recession in U.S. 
when investment dropped below historical average and stayed at these low levels for several years.

Early contribution on investment uncertainty literature was by Dixit and Pindyck.
They argue that uncertainty creates **real options** for investment.
Firm has option to invest but need not exercise the option now - can wait for more information.
Options are many:
1. Option to delay project
2. Option to stop before completion
3. Option to abandon after completion
4. Option to temporarily stop producing
Under uncertainty, NPV of waiting/delaying might be higher than NPV of investing now.

Real options arise only when investment decisions cannot be reversed. 
If investment is irreversible (sunk cost), there is an opportunity cost of investing now rather than waiting.
Opportunity cost (the value of option) can be very large.
Higher the uncertainty higher is the value of option.

Examples of investment involving sunk costs:

1. Building an oil tanker
2. Scrapping a tanker.
3. Undertaking an R&D program
4. Building a new plant

Under option theory of Dixit and Pindyck, investment behaviour becomes cautious.
However, the theory cannot be tested on firm level data which does not exhibit the “wait and see” approach.
We now turn to a study by Bloom, Bond and Van Reenen (2007).
They theoretically model and empirically examine the effects of demand uncertainty on investment allowing for plant and firm level disaggregation.

Question: *Can the effects of uncertainty and irreversibility be detected in an econometric study using firm-level data?*

They build a model incorporating both uncertainty about demand + irreversibility.
Irreversibility is modelled as difference in the purchase and resell price of capital.
Uncertainty about demand is modelled as a time-varying variance in the process that determines the product price.

Different specifications of adjustment costs. Allow for aggregation across:
1. different types of complementary capital like structures, equipment and vehicles, and

2. production units or plants, each firm on average has around 220 plants (based on U.K. data)

**Main Result**: With irreversibility, the impact effect on investment of a given firm level demand shock tends to be weaker for firms that are subject to a higher level of uncertainty.

Compare model results with real data sample containing 672 publicly traded U.K. manufacturing companies over the period 1972-1991. 
Find evidence:
1. of more cautious investment behaviour for firms subject to greater uncertainty and
2. of a convex response of investment to real sales growth.

They conclude that investment behaviour of large firms is consistent with a partial irreversibility model in which uncertainty dampens the short run adjustment of investment to demand shocks.

Finally, simulations of their model suggest that observed fluctuations in uncertainty can play an important role shaping firm level investment decisions. 
For example, a one standard deviation increase in the uncertainty measure, like that which occurred after September 11, 2001 and the 1973 oil crisis can **halve** the impact effect of demand shocks on company investment.

First implication - the short-run response of investment to demand shocks will be lower at higher levels of uncertainty. 
The slope of these response function is lower at higher levels of uncertainty.

Comparing investment responses with -10% and +25% demand growth
1. The gradient of the investment response to demand growth approximately doubles when moving from the third quartile to the first quartile of the distribution of uncertainty.
2. Approximately triples when when moving from the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile.

In an attempt to capture all relevant factors in one scalar measure, authors follow the approach suggested by Leahy and Whited (1996). 
They use the standard deviation of stock returns for each firm in every accounting year. 
Intuitively the variance in a firm’s stock return captures uncertainty about its future demand and / or productivity conditions.

Figure 2 plots the predicted response of investment rates for observations at different levels of uncertainty.
Large “cautionary” effect of higher uncertainty on the short-run investment response.

Moving from the third quartile to the first quartile in the distribution of the measure of uncertainty doubles the impact, while moving from the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile increases it by fourfold. 
This substantial impact of uncertainty is similar to the findings from the simulation model suggesting that an effect of this size is consistent with a real options explanation (Dixit and Pindyck).

### Remarks

Uncertainty creates zones of action/inaction. 
Uncertainty increases the separation between the marginal product of capital which justifies investment and the marginal product of capital which justifies disinvestment. 
This increases the range of inaction where investment is zero as the firm prefers to “wait and see” rather than undertaking a costly action with uncertain consequences. 
The dampened response of investment to demand shocks in this literature suggests that firms will less respond less to monetary and fiscal stimuli in periods of high uncertainty.
