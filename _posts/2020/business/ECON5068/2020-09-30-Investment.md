这将是damien在学习课程《投资，金融与资产定价》的时候的一个读书笔记的系列。这篇博客是投资这个单元的第一篇笔记。

## 1. Define Investment
定义投资

<br>

Investment refers to accumulation of means of production. Means of production is any input such as physical capital and/or labor that can be transformed to output.  
投资指的是生产资料的积累。生产资料是任何可以被转化为产出的投入，比如说实体资本以及/或者劳动力。

<!-- Investments are thus desired changes in capital.

因此，投资是（预期资本变动？）。 -->

We focus mainly on physical capital in this section so that investments refer to physical investments. In National Accounts, physical investment is the construction both of residential and nonresidential buildings, as well as equipment (machines, computers, etc.) and durable goods (cars, furnitures, etc.).  
我们在这一节主要地关注实体资本，所以投资指代的是实物投资。在国民经济核算中，实物投资是指住宅和非住宅建筑的建设，设备（机器、计算机等）和耐用品（汽车、家具等）。

Modern economies undertake very large investments that do not only take the form of physical machinery. Firms invest in R&D and in employees through training, they also invest through advertising in brand names and recognition to build up a customer base, etc. Investment can also be on housing or residential assets. Investment refers broadly to all kind of choices which have a cost today and an uncertain benefit in the future.  
现代经济实体从事着巨大的投资，它们不仅是以实体的器具的形式进行的。公司投资于研发和在员工的培训上，他们也投资品牌及其知名度的广告以构建用户基础等等。 投资也可以是住房或者住宅资产。广义上的投资是指当前存在成本且未来收益不确定的各种选择。

Investment is highly volatile, which is around 3-4% more volatile than GDP. Small changes in GDP usually cause big changes in Investment.

投资是高度地波动的，比国内生产总值的波动性大3-4%。国民生产总值中的微小的改变通常会导致投资中的巨大变化。

## 2. Some empirical facts on investments 
投资上的一些经验事实

These statistics are for the whole aggregate economy. To properly understand the behavior and determinants of aggregate investment, we need to study investment at the **firm/business level**.
这些统计数据是针对整个总体的经济。为了正确理解总投资的行为和决定因素，我们需要研究企业/商业层面的投资。

![The share of firms by employment size of firms in the U.S.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/business/share_by_employment_size.png "The share of firms by employment size of firms in the U.S.")

Accoding to the Census from DB Global Markets Research, the total number of firms (public + private) in the US is around 5-6 million. 90% of these firms have less than 20 employees. Besides, the number of public listed firms have been declining while substantial entry and exit of firms.  
根据DB Global Markets Research的普查，美国的（公立和私立的）公司的总数大约是500-600万。百分之九十的拥有不足20名员工。此外，上市公司的数量一直在下降，而大量的公司上市和退市。

## 3. How do firms choose Investment?
公司如何选择投资？

Investment has both benefits and costs. Benefits are that more investment means more capital and more capital means more production and profits. The cost of buying and using new capital cannot be ignored. Optimal Investment shoud therefore compare the marginal benefit of new capital vesus the marginal cost of installing this capital.  
投资有收益也有成本。收益是指越多的投资意味着越多的资本，越多的资本意味着越多的生产和利润。购买和使用新资本的成本也不可以忽视。因此，最优的投资应将新资本的边际效益与安置该资本的边际成本相比较。

We will start with a two-period investment model. Consider the problem of a firm that lives for only two periods. The firm starts with capital ***K<sub>1</sub>*** in the beginning of period 1 and it has to decide on how much to invest in period 1.  
我们将从一个连个周期的投资模型开始。我们将从两个时期的投资模式开始。考虑一个只存在两个时期的公司的问题。公司在第1期的开始时从资本 ***K<sub>1</sub>*** 开始，它必须决定在第1期投资多少。

The cost of ***I<sub>1</sub>*** units of investments is ***P<sup>K</sup><sub>1</sub>*** · ***I<sub>1</sub>***, where ***P<sup>K</sup><sub>1</sub>*** is the price of a unit of capital. The stock of capital in the second period depends on the depreciation rate ***δ*** and the level of investments today ***I<sub>1</sub>***.     
***I<sub>1</sub>*** 单位的投资的成本是 ***P<sup>K</sup><sub>1</sub>*** · ***I<sub>1</sub>***，其中 ***P<sup>K</sup><sub>1</sub>*** 是单位资本的价格。第二阶段的资本存量取决于折旧率 ***δ*** 和当前投资水平 ***I<sub>1</sub>***。

The second period capital is given by:  $ \nabla $
