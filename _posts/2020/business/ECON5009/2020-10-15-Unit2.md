### 1.1 Forward Contracts

1. **Definition**: A forward contract is an **agreement**, i.e. a binding commitment, to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price.

2. A forward contract is traded in the **over-the-counter market**. The party who takes **the long position** agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price. The other party who takes **the short position** agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price.
