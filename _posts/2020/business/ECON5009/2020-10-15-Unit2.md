### 1.1 Forwards
**Forward Contracts**

1. **Definition**: A forward contract is an **agreement**, i.e. a binding commitment, to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price.

A forward contract is traded in the **over-the-counter market**. 
The party who takes **the long position** agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price. 
The other party who takes **the short position** agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price.

### 1.2 Futures
**Futures Contracts**

1. **Definition**: A futures contract is an **agreement** between two parties to buy or seAll an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price with (daily) clearing through a margin account.

Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts are normally **traded on an exchange**. 
This suggests that, the exchange specifies certain standardized features of the contract, i.e. the underlying asset, the contract size and delivery details; 
the exchange also provides a mechanism that gives the two parties of the futures contract a guarantee that the contract will be honored.

- Underlying assets: commodities, e.g. lumber, crude oil, gold; financial assets, e.g. stock indices, currencies, Treasury bonds.

- **Delivery Month**: A futures contract is referred to by its delivery month. 
For instance, the product code of CME Gold futures contract for December 2019 is 'GCZ19'.

The trader who agrees to buy has a **long futures position** in the contract; the trader who agrees to sell has a **short futures position** in the contract. 
The price agrred to is the current futures price, which is determined by the law of supply and demand.

- Market Quetos: last trade, change, priort settlement, open, high, low, trading volume.

### 1.3 The Operation of Margin Accounts

1. One of  the  key roles of  the  exchange is to	use **margin accounts** to	organize trading so that contract defaults are avoided.

2. The	amount that  must  be deposited  at  the  time the contract  is entered  into  is known as the	**initial margin**.

3. At  the  end of  each trading day, the margin  account  is adjusted to	reflect the investor's  gain or loss.
This  practice  is referred to	as **daily settlement** or **marking to  market**.
More specifically, a trade is first settled at  the  close of the	day  on which  it takes place.
It	is then settled at the close of trading on each subsequent	day.
By contrast, the forward contracts are settled at the expiry.

4. To ensure that the balance in the margin account never becomes negative a **maintenance margin** is set.
If  the  balance in the	margin account falls below the  maintenance  margin, the  investor  receives  a  margin call and is expected to top	up the  margin  account  to  the  initial  margin  level by the	end of the next day.

5. The	extra  funds deposited  are known  as a  variation margin.	
If the investor does not	provide the variation margin, the broker **closes out the position by entering into the opposite trade to the original one**.

**An example**

Both forward and futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an assset for a certain price at a certain future time.
The main differences between forward and futures contracts are summarised in the following table.

        \text{Comparison of Forward and Futures Contract.} \\\\

    \end{array}    
$$



### 1.4 Arbitrage

**Arbitrage: Non-dividend-paying Stock**

- **Arbitrage**: an arbitrage is defined as a trading strategy that require zero initial investment, has zero probability of losing money, and has a positive probability of making money.

**A mathematical model that admits arbitrage leads to contradictions.** 
Wealth could be generated from nothing in such a model, in consequence prices would adjust through supply and demand to eliminate the arbitrage. 
CAPM uses a slightly different notion of arbitrage!  

We use **arbitrage arguments** to determine the forward and futures prices of an investment asset from its spot price and other observable market variables.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5009/arbitrageOpportunities.png "Arbitrage Opportunities (without dividends) (Hull(2015) p.108)")

### 1.5 Forward Price (no income)
**Forward Price for an Investment: No Income**

From Example 5, the first arbitrage works as long as the forward price is greater than 40.5; the second arbitrage works as long as the forward price is less than 40.5.

Based on the previous analysis, now consider a forward contract on an investment asset with price \\( S_0\\) that provides no income ( and no costs), e.g. non-dividend-paying stocks.
The relationship between \\( F_0\\) and \\( S_0\\) is 

$$
    F_0 = S_0 e^{rT} 
    \tag{2} \label{forwardPrice}
$$

If \\( F_0 > S_0 e^{rT} \\), arbitrageurs can buy the asset and short forward contracts on the asset; if \\( F_0 < S_0 e^{rT} \\), arbitrageurs can short the asset and enter into long forward contract on it.

**Intuition**: consider the following strategy:	buy one unit of the asset and enter into a short forward contract to sell it for \\( F_0\\) at time \\(T\\). Buying the asset costs \\( S_0\\), the strategy is certain to lead to	a cash inflow of \\( F_0\\) at time \\(T\\). 
Therefore, \\( S_0\\) must equal the present value of \\( F_0\\), i.e. \\( S_0 = F_0 e^{-rT}\\). Thus, \\( F_0 = S_0 e^{rT}\\). 

Indeed, using equation \eqref{forwardPrice}, the forward price from Example 5 is
$$
    F_0 = 40e^{0.05 \times 0.25} = 40.5.
$$

**Arbitrage: Coupon-bearing Bond**
 
Guideline for arbitrage: the guiding principle of taking arbitrage opportunity is to buy low and sell high.	
In other words, when the forward price is higher than its no-arbitrage theoretical value, arbitrageurs buy the underlying asset; 
when the forward price is lower than its no-arbitrage theoretical value, arbitrageurs sell the underlying asset.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5009/arbitrageOpportunities_knownIncome.png "Arbitrage Opportunities (Known Income) (Hull(2015) p.110)")

**Forward Price	for	an Investment Asset: Known Income**

When an investment asset will provide known income with a present value of \\( G \\) during the life of a forward contract, we have:

$$
    F_0 = (S_0 - G) e^{rT}
    \tag{3} \label{forwardPriceWithIncome}
$$

Indeed, in Example 6, the forward price is:

$$
    F_0 = (900-39.6)e^{0.004 \times 0.75} = 886.6.
$$

If \\( F_0 > (S_0 - G) e^{rT}\\), an arbitrageur can lock in a profit by buying the asset and shorting a forward contract on the asset; if\\( F_0 < (S_0 - G) e^{rT}\\), an arbitrageur can lock in a profit by shorting the asset and taking a long position in a forward contract.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5009/ForwardPrice.png "Forward price (stock paying known dividends) (Hull(2015) p.111)")

We now consider the case where the asset underlying a forward contract provides a known yield, i.e.	a return provided by an instrument.	This means that the income is known when expressed as a percentage of the asset's price at the time the income is paid.

The yield is normally measured with continuous compounding.	A yield measured with one compounding frequency can be translated to a yield measured with another compounding frequency:

\\[
    R_c = m \cdot ln(1+ \frac{R_m}{m})
    \tag{4} \label{yield}
\\]

&emsp;where \\(R_c\\) denotes the annualized continuous-compounding yield; \\(m\\) is the compounding  frequency; \\(R_m\\) represents the annualized discrete-compounding yield.

After translating discrete-compounding yield into continuous-compounding yield,  we are ready to derive the forward price.	Define \\( q \\) as the average yield per annum on an asset during the life of a forward contract with continuous compounding. The forward price of an investment asset with known yield is:

\\[
    F_0 = S_0 e^{(r-q)T}
    \tag{5} \label{forwardPriceWithYield}
\\]

    Consider a 6-month forward contract on an asset that is expected to provide income equal to	2% of the 
    asset price once during a 6-month  period;  r = 10%; So =25. Therefore, the annualized yield is 4% with 
    semiannual compounding. Using equation (4), the corresponding continuous-compounding yield can be 
    computed as 3.96%. Thus, from equation (5), the forward price is

\\[
    25e^{(0.1-0.0396) \times 0.5} = 25.77
\\]

**Valuing Forward Contracts**

**Timing of the life of forward contract:** 

Time 0 is the beginning of the life of the forward contract; time \\(t\\) is the current time, i.e. today; time \\(T\\) is	the delivery date (or maturity) of the forward contract.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5009/timeline.png "The Timeline of Forward Contract")

Suppose \\(K\\) is the delivery price for the contract that was negotiated at time 0 and \\(K = F'_0 \\), i.e. is set equal to the forward price at  time 0. As time passes, \\(K\\) stays constant (because it is agreed at time 0). \\( F_t\\) is the forward price that would be applicable if we negotiated the contract today. \\(T- t\\) is the time to maturity. In addition, we define \\(f_t\\) as the value of forward contract today.

Because it	costs nothing to enter into a forward  contract,  the  value  of a forward contract at the time  it  is first  entered  into is zero. As time evolves, due to the fluctuations of the interest rate and the spot  price  of  underlying asset, the forward price \\(f_t\\) changes and the value of the contract can become either positive or negative.

A general result, applicable to the value of any long forward contract, is:

\\[
     f_t = (F_t - K)e ^{-r(T-t)}
     \tag{6} \label{forwardValue}
\\]

**Intuition:**

1. We form a portfolio today consisting of (a) a forward contract to  buy  the underlying  asset  for \\( K\\) at  time \\( T\\) T, and	(b) a forward  contract  to sell the	asset for \\(F_t\\) at time \\(T\\).

2. The  payoff from the	portfolio at time \\(T\\) is \\(S_T - K\\) from contract (a) and \\(F_t - S_T\\) from contract (b).

3. The total payoff is \\( F_t - K\\) and is known for certain today. The portfolio  is therefore a risk-free investment and its value today is the payoff at time \\(T\\) discounted at the risk-free rate, i.e. \\( (F_t - K)e^{-r(T-t)}\\).

4. The  value of the forward  contract   (b)  is  worth  zero  because \\(F_t\\) is the forward price  that  applies  to   a  forward  contract  entered	into today.

5. Therefore,  the  value of a  long forward  contract to  buy an  asset for  \\( K\\)  at time \\(T\\)  must  be \\( (F_t - K)e^{-r(T-t)}\\).

6. Similarly, the	value  of  a  short  forward  contract  to sell the	asset for  \\( K\\)  at	time \\(T\\) is \\( (K- F_t)e^{-r(T-t)}\\).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5009/forwardValue.png "Valuing forward contracts (Hull (2015) p.113)")

**Are Forward Prices and Futures Prices Equal?**


\\( \underline{\text{Technical Note 24}} \\) from **Hull** (2015) uses the	arbitrage  argument  to  show that, when the risk-free rate is constant, the  forward  price  for  a  contract  with a certain  delivery date is **in theory** the same as the	futures price for  a contract with  that delivery  date.	This argument can be extended to the case where the interest  rate is a known function of time, i.e. as long as the interest rate is not stochastic.


The intuition is as follows: Assume spot and interest rate are positively correlated.

- if  the  interest  rate rises,  then the  spot  price is likely  rising as well \\(\implies \\) due to the daily setllement in the futures contract, money can be released from the margin account and be invested at a higher interest rate
- if  the  interest  rate falls,  then the  spot  price is likely  falling as well \\(\implies \\) due to the  daily settlement,  money needs to	be paid into the margin account, but this money can now be borrowed at a lower interest rate
- relative to  a  forward  contract,  which is not	affect by any of this, the futures contract  benefits  from  interest  rate movements,  and this raises the	futures price as compared to the forward price

If spot and interest rate are negatively correlated, the opposite effect occurs, which lowers the	futures price relative to the forward price.

However, the theoretical differences between forward and futures prices for contracts that last only a few months are in most circumstances sufficiently small to	be ignored.	In **Hull** (2015),  for  most purposes it	is reasonable to assume that forward  and futures prices  are the	same.

 **Futures	Prices of Stock	Indices**

A stock index can usually be regarded as the price of an investment asset that pays dividends.	
The investment asset is the portfolio of stocks composing the stock index, and the dividends paid by the investment asset are the dividends that would be received  by the  holder of this portfolio.
It is usually assumed that the dividends provide a known yield (relative to the stock index) rather than a known cash income.

Assume \\(q \\) is the  average  annualised  dividend  yield  during the  life of  the contract, the futures price, \\( F_0 \\) , is:

$$
    F_0 = S_0 e ^{(r-q)T}.
    \tag{7} \label{futurePrice}
$$

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5009/futuresPrices.png "Futures Prices of Stock Indices (Hull (2015) p.116)")

**Index Arbitrage**: if \\(F_0 > S_0 e ^{(r-q)T} \\),	arbitrage  profit  can  be  made  by  buying the stocks underlying the index at the spot price and shorting the stock index futures contracts;  on the  other  hand,   \\(F_0 < S_0 e ^{(r-q)T} \\),	profit  can  be obtained  by shorting or
selling the stocks underlying the stock index and taking a long position in futures contracts.

**Hedging: Basic Principles**

Many  market  participants  in futures  markets are hedgers.	Their  aim is to	use futures markets to	reduce exposure to	a  particular risk, e.g.	fluctuation in the crude oil price.	In other words, the  hedgers  take  a  position  in  futures contracts which neutralises the risk as far as possible.

*	Consider a compony A that expects it  will gain 10000 for each 1 cent  increase  in the price of crude oil over the next 3 months and lose 10000 for each 1 cent
decrease in the	price of crude oil during the next 3 months.
*	To hedge, compony A should take a short futures position that is designed to offset
th is risk.  The  futures  position  shouId lead to	a loss of 10000 for each 1  cent increase in the price of crude oil over the 3 months,  and  a gain of  10000 for each 1 cent  decrease in the	price of crude oil during this period.
*	In other words, if the price of crude oil goes down, the gain on the futures position
offsets the  loss; if the	price of crude oil goes up, the loss on the futures position is offset by the gain from crude oil.

**Short Hedges**: a short hedge is a  hedge that  involves taking a short  position in futures contracts.
* A short hedge is appropriate when the hedger already owns an asset and
expects  to sell it	at some time in the future.
* A short hedge can also be used when an asset is not owned right  now but  will  be owned at some time in the future.

**Long Hedges**: a long hedge is a  hedge that  involves taking a  long position in futures contracts.
*	A long hedge is appropriate when a company knows it will have to purchase a certain  asset in the	future and wants to lock in a price now.

Comment: if the exposure is such that the company gains when the price of the asset increases and loses when the price of the asset decreases, a short hedge is appropriate.
On the other hand, if the exposure is such that the company gains when the price of the asset decreases and loses when the  price of the asset increases, a long hedge is appropriate (**Hull** (2015)).

**Cross Hedging**

The asset underlying the futures contract is different  from the asset  whose  price is being hedged.	
For example, an airline may want to hedge the fluctuation in  the  price of jet fuel.	
Because  futures on jet	fuel are not actively traded, the airline could use heating oil futures contracts to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price fluctuation.

**Hedge Ratio**: the ratio of the size of the	position taken in futures contracts relative to the size of the exposure.

*	When  the  asset  underlying  the  futures  contract is the	same as the asset being hedged,  i.e.	no  cross hedging,  the	hedge ratio is 1.
* When   cross   hedging occurs,  the	hedger  needs  to  choose  a  value for the	hedge ratio such that **the variance of the value  of  the  hedged  position  is minimised**.	This  value of the	hedge ratio is referred to as **the minimum variance hedge ratio**.

**The Minimum Variance Hedge Ratio**

Consider the case where the investor takes a long position in asset \\(S\\) and a short position in the futures contract \\( F\\). Define:

*	\\(\Delta S\\):	change in spot price during a period of time equal to the life of the hedge;
*	\\(\Delta F\\):	change in futures price during a period of time equal to the life of the hedge;
*   \\(\sigma _S\\):	standard deviation of \\(\Delta S\\);
*   \\(\sigma _F\\):	standard deviation of \\(\Delta F\\);
*	\\(\rho _{SF}\\):	correlation between	\\(\Delta S\\) and \\(\Delta F\\);
*	\\(h\\): minimum variance hedge ratio.

In addition,  define \\(\Delta U = \Delta S - h \Delta F\\) as **the hedged position**.

To find the minimum  variance  hedge  ratio  \\(h\\), we need to	minimise \\(Var(\Delta U)\\).

Using the definition of the hedged position, i.e.  \\(\Delta U = \Delta S - h \Delta F\\) , we have:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        Var(\Delta U) & = Var( \Delta S - h \Delta F) \\\\
        & = \sigma ^2_S + h^2 \sigma ^2_F - 2 h \rho_{SF} \sigma _S \sigma _F \ .
    \end{aligned}
    \tag{8} \label{variance}
$$

&emsp;The Relationship between Variance of Hedged Position and Hedge Ratio (Hull (2015))

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien0x0023/damien0x0023.github.io/master/assets/images/2020/ECON5009/hedgeVariance.png "Variance and Hedge Ratio (Hull (2015)")

Therefore, by setting

$$
    \frac{\partial Var(\Delta S - h \Delta F)}{\partial h} = 2 h \sigma ^2_F - 2 \rho _{SF} \sigma _S \sigma _F = 0 \ ,
    \tag{9} \label{setting}
$$

we derive the value of the minimum variance hedge ratio:

$$
    h = \rho _{SF} \frac{\sigma _S}{\sigma _F}
    \tag{10} \label{minRatio}
$$

The  slope  coefficient  obtained  from  a  linear regression of \\(\Delta S\\) on\\(\Delta F\\) (i.e. \\(\Delta S _i = \alpha +\beta \Delta F _i \\) ) is given by:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
        J _S & = \frac {\sigma _SF} {\sigma ^2_F} \\\\
             & = \frac {\rho _{SF} \sigma _S \sigma _F} {\sigma _F \sigma _F} \\\\
             & = \rho _{SF} \frac {\sigma _S} {\sigma _F}
    \end{aligned}
    \tag{11} \label{slopeCoefficient}
$$

Therefore,  from equation  \eqref{minRatio} and \eqref{slopeCoefficient}, the hedge ratio  is **the slope coeffficient	obtained  from  a linear regression of \\(\Delta S\\) against \\(\Delta F\\)**.
This is relevant for empirical analysis.

**Optimal Number of Contracts**

Formula  \eqref{minRatio} derived  from   \eqref{variance} covers the	case, where one future contract covers one  unit of the underlying,  to  hedge  one  unit of  the asset. 
In general futures contracts cover  a  larger size in the	underlying and  are being used to	hedge a larger size of the	asset.  
To calculate the number of contracts that should be used in hedging, define:

*	\\(N^*\\): optimal number of futures contracts used for hedging;
*	\\(Q_A\\):	size of  position  being hedged; e.g.	number  of  units of assets
*	\\(Q_F\\):	size of  one futures  contract;  i.e the  number  of  units of  the  underlying one future contract refers to

The  futures  contracts  should  be on  \\(hQ_A\\)  units of the asset.	The	number of futures contracts required is therefore given by

$$
    N^* = \frac {hQ_A}{Q_F}
    \tag{12} \label{numbers}
$$

**Using Stock	Index	Futures	to	Hedge	Equity	Portfolios**

Stock index futures can be used to	hedge equity portfolios.	Define:

*	\\(V_A\\):	current  value of the	equity portfolio;
*	\\(V_F\\)   :	current  nominal  value of one	futures contract (i.e. the futures price times the contract size).

If  the  portfolio  mirrors  the index, i.e. \\( \rho_{AF} =1\\) and \\( \sigma_A =\sigma _F\\), the	optimal hedge ratio  \\(h\\) could be assumed to	be 1.	The number of futures contracts that should be shorted is:

$$
    N^* = \frac {V_A}{V_F}
    \tag{13} \label{num}
$$

*	Suppose that a portfolio \\(A\\) worth 5050000 mirrors the S&P500 Index. The index futures price is 1010; each futures contract is on 250 times the index value.
* In  this  case,  \\(V_A  = 5050000\\);  \\(V_F  = 1010 \times 250 =  252500\\).	Thus, \\(N^* = 5050000 /252500 = 20\\), i.e.	20  futures  contracts  need  to	be shorted to hedge the	portfolio.

In the  case  that  the portfolio does not	mirror the stock index, we can use the beta from the CAPM to determine the number of futures contracts, i.e.

$$
    N^* = \beta \frac {V_A}{V_F}
    \tag{14} \label{num2}
$$

&emsp;where it	is assumed  that the maturity of the futures contract  is close to	the maturity of the hedge.

**Intuition**:

* By comparing equation \eqref{numbers} with equation \eqref{num2}, we see that \\(\beta \\) functions as \\(h\\).  
Because the  hedge ratio \\(h\\) is the  slope of the  best-fit  line from  a linear regression of	\\(\Delta S\\)	against	\\(\Delta F\\);	\\(\beta \\)  is the slope of the best-fit  line when the return on the portfolio is regressed against the return on the stock index.
*	suppose, for example, the portfolio's \\(\beta \\)  is 2, this portfolio is twice as sensitive to  the  movements  in  the  stock  index  as  a  portfolio  with a \\(\beta \\)  of	1.	It is therefore necessary to	use twice as many futures contracts to hedge this portfolio.

Assume  that  a  futures  contract  with  time to	maturity of 4 months is used to hedge  the  value of a	portfolio over the	next 3 months in the following situation:

$$
    \begin{array}{c}
    \hline
    \text{Value of S&P 500 Index} = 1000 \\\\
    \text{S&P 500 futures price} = 1010 \\\\
    \text{Value of the portfolio} = 5050000 \\\\
    \text{Risk-free interest rate} = 4 \% \text{ per annum} \\\\
    \text{Dividend yield on index} = 1 \% \text{ per annum} \\\\
    \text{Beta of the portfolio} = 1.5 \\\\
    \hline
    \end{array}
$$

In this case,  \\(V_F  = 1010 \times 250 =  252500\\).	Using equation \eqref{num2}, the	number of futures  contracts   that	need to	be shorted	to	hedge the portfolio is:

$$
    1.5 \times \frac {5050000} {252500} = 30
$$


Now suppose the	S&P	500	ndex turns out to be 900 in 3 months; and the futures  price  in 3  months is 902.	The gain from the short position in the futures contract is:

$$
    30 \times (1010 - 902) \times 250 = 810000
$$

The	loss on the  stock index is \\(|(900 - 1000)/1000| = 10 \\)%. 
The stock index pays a dividend of 1% per annum,  or 0.25%  per 3 months. 
Taking the dividends into account, the investor in the stock index would earn \\(-10 \% + 0.25\% = -9.75\%\\) over the 3-month period.

According to the CAPM, the expected return on the portfolio can be computed as:

$$
    1\% + 1.5 \times (-9.75 \% - 1 \%) = -15.125 \%
$$

The  expected  value  of  the  portfolio  at the end of the	3 months is therefore:

$$
    5050000   \times    (1 + (-15.125 \%))	= 4286187.
$$

Thus,  the  expected  value of  the  hedger's position, i.e.	the expected value of the portfolio plus the gain from the short futures position, is:

$$
    4286187 + 810000 = 5096187.
$$

In Hull (2015), the (conditional) expected values of the  hedger's  position  are calculated  for other  values of  stock  index  at maturity.The results are shown in the following table.

It can be seen from the table that **the total value of the hedger's position in  3 months is almost independent of the value of the index**, i.e. the variance of the value of  the  hedged  position has been minimised.	In other words, the  equity  portfolio is hedged.

**What	is an	Option	Contract?**

Types of Option: there are two types of option:

*	**Call Option**:	a call option gives the holder **the right** to buy the underlying asset  **by a certain date** for  a  certain price;

*  **Put Option**:	a put	option  gives  the  holder  **the right** to sell the underlying asset **by a certain date** for a certain price.

Option vs. Forward and Futures:	it should be noted that an option gives the holder **the right, but not the obligation**, to buy or sell an asset.	
In other words, the	holder does not	have to	exercise this right.	
This is what distinguishes options from forwards  and futures,  where the  holder  is obligated to  buy  or sell the	underlying asset.	
Furthermore, whereas it	costs nothing to enter into a forward or futures contract, there is a **cost** to	acquiring an option.
