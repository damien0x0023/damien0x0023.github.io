# Unit 4 Testing Q

translated by damien from sildes of Sisi Ramanan

## 1. Investment Q Model

This model predicts that investment and Q are related. 
Knowing Q is **sufficient** to predict what the investment level
will be. 
Is Q readily observable in the data?

Remember Q is given by, 
\\[Q = \beta E[V _{K'} (\theta ', K')] \\]
the derivative of the value function, hence called Marginal Q.
To test Q theory, we need to measure this value.
The marginal value is unobservable making empirical testing
of investment Q models extremely difficult.

As the value function and hence its derivative is not observable, testing adjustment cost investment model is difficult.

We need to find a suitable proxy for the derivative of the value function.

A good proxy is to substitute the marginal value of the firm with its average value.

Under what conditions is the average value a good proxy for the marginal value?


## 1.2 Hayashi's Result

Hayashi (1982) established some conditions under which the
average and marginal Q coincide.


**Proposition**

Hayashi showed that a rm's marginal Q equals average Q when
the following three conditions are satised:
1. The rm is a price taker in the output market.
2. Production function is linearly homogenous.
3. Cost functions are linearly homogenous.

The first condition says that the firm is operating in a perfectly competitive environment such that it has no power in the pricing of its output product. The market determines the product price.

Linear homogeneity means homogenous functions of order one.

A production function which is homogenous of degree one displays constant returns to scale.

Note: Refer to Marginal and Average q pdf on Moodle for more on this.

Hayashi‚Äôs results form the basis of empirically implementing the investment Q model and facilitates its testing.

We can now substitute the unobservable marginal Q with the
observable average Q.

 
That is,

Marginal Q = E [VK
 

(Œ∏I, KI)] = V
K

= Average Q

## 1.3. Empirical Testing

Tests of Q theory on panel data are frequently conducted
using the following empirical specication:

Iit=Kit = a0 + a1Qit + a2Xit + it (1)

This is a panel regression, where the subscript i denotes the
individual rm (or plant) and t denotes time.

We are regressing investment rate I =K on Q and some
control(s) X.

What is the role of these controls Xit ?

Q theory says that the value of Q is sufficient to incorporate all relevant information related to production and investment. That is, no other variable should impact investment.

These variables Xit are included as a means of testing the theory, where the theory predicts that these variables from the information set should be insignificant.

In other words, the coefficient a2 should be statistically insignificant.

The estimate of the coefficient aÀÜ1 also provides information on the adjustment cost paramter.

This comes from a modification of the adjustment costs to the form:
C (KI, K ) = œÜ ( KI ‚àí (1 ‚àí Œ¥K ) ‚àí a )


We will focus on three seminal papers in the investment literature - Fazzari, Hubbard, Petersen (1988), Gilchrist and Himmelberg (1995) and Cooper and Ejarque (2003).

These papers make use of Hayashi‚Äôs proposition and test the Q theory of investment.

Question: Can investment be entirely explained by average Q?
1 If yes, then this validates the Q model of investment.
2 If no, what other variables are important in explaining firm level investment?


## FHP 1988

Empirical Implementation of Q Model - Fazzaari, Hubbard, Petersen (1988)

We will start with the paper by Fazzari, Hubbard, Petersen (1988).

FHP postulate a regression of the form:

Iit /Kit = a0 + a1Qit + a2(CFit /Kit ) + Eit	(1)

where the investment rate is regressed on average Q and a control given by cashflow over capital.

The idea is that if there are financial constraints (or capital market imperfections), then these will be felt more at firms that are either unable to find it or difficult to obtain at a reasonable cost.

If their idea is true, then investment for financially constrained firms will depend on variables other than Q.

Testing the coefficient a2 might provide evidence for this conjecture.

The control variable suggested by FHP is cash-flow.


They classify firms into three groups:
1. Class 1: Dividends/Income < 0.1
2. Class 2: 0.1 < Dividends/Income < 0.2
3. Class 3: All other firms.


Data:
1. Value Line, US firms
2. Time period: 1970-1984
3. Manufacturing Sector

Measuring Q:
1. Q at the beginning of the period
2. Ratio of market value (value of equity plus value of debt) over replacement value of capital.

The summary table suggests the following:
1. Firms in class 1 and 2 have retained most of their income in the majority of years.
2. Are relatively small.
3. Have experience most growth in their capital stock.
4. Exhaust almost all of their cash flow in their investment.
5. They also exhibit a much higher correlation of investment to cash flow.

## Results and Issues

More financially constrained firms (Class 1) exhibit significantly greater investment cash flow sensitivities than firms that appear less financially constrained.

Difference in cash flow coefficients between different classes of firms are always statistically significant.

R2 is always higher for these firms.



These results are robust to a number of checks:
1. Possible measurement errors in Q.

2. Using lagged values (last period for instance) of Q and CF /K .

3. Using end of period Q.

4. Alternate measurement of Q by using sales.

5. Results are consistent across different industries.




Possible issues with their approach:
1. Q may not be accurately reflecting market fundamentals due to excessive volatility in equity market.

2. Measurement errors in Q could be correlated with cash flow.

3. Cash flow may reflect news about future profitability of investment that is not captured by beginning of period Q.
